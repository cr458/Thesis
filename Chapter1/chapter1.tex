Gallium nitride \nomenclature[z-GaN]{GaN}{Gallium Nitride} (GaN) has been termed the 'most important semiconductor material since silicon' \cite{Humphreys2008}, and indeed the influence of this incredible material and it's associated alloys (termed III-nitrides) is pervasive in modern society. The impact of III-nitride materials is perhaps best evidenced by the global transition from traditional lighting sources to semiconductor lighting solutions based on III-nitride materials. Since the first demonstration of a high-brightness blue light emitting diode \nomenclature[z-LED]{LED}{Light-Emitting Diode} (LED) in 1991 by Shuji Nakamura \cite{Nakamura1991}, the widespread use of LEDs for general lighting purposes has blossomed into a multi-billion pound industry. The extraordinary optical properties of III-nitride materials have enabled their application outside of the lighting industry: the development of III-nitride based lasers has found applications in telecommunications \cite{Najda2015}, medicine \cite{BerlienBreuerMuellerEtAl2012} and data storage . Furthermore, III-nitride optical emitters have been used as single photon sources \nomenclature[z-SPS]{SPS}{Single Photon Source} (SPSs) which have applications in cryptography for secure communications \cite{Kako2006}.
\\The optoelectronic properties of III-nitride materials are somewhat astonishing: GaN suffers from a defect density several orders of magnitude higher than other optically active semiconductor materials such as gallium arsenide \nomenclature[z-GaAs]{GaAs}{Gallium Arsenide} (GaAs) \cite{Bennett2010b} yet is still optically active. Despite this, the effects of defects originating from the heteropitaxial growth of GaN are clearly deleterious when considering III-nitride device operation. 
This work aims to explore the manner in which the microstructural properties of photonic III-nitride devices affect their performance by combining multiple microscopy techniques, an approach we term 'multi-microscopy', thus allowing us to link specific structural features with emissive properties at the device level. The experimental research in this thesis is separated into four main sections. 
\\The first section details the investigation of inhomogeneous electroluminescence \nomenclature[z-EL]{EL}{Electroluminescence} (EL) of indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) LEDs. By employing the use of scanning probe techniques, electron microscopy and spectroscopy the underpinning cause of LED behaviour was elucidated and reported.
\\The second section involves microscopy-based investigation into the mechanisms behind incomplete etching in the fabrication of III-nitride based microdisk cavities and the effect of this issue on the overall optical performance of these cavities
\\The third section describes the microscopy of one dimensional \nomenclature[z-1-D]{1-D}{One-Dimensional} (1-D) photonic crystal cavity (PCC) 'nanobeam' cavities. The intrinsic resistance of III-nitride based materials can often result in improperly etched features, which can results in high optical losses in cavities. This section concerns the use of tomographic techniques such as electron tomography \nomenclature[z-ET]{ET}{Electron Tomography} (ET) and focussed ion beam tomography \nomenclature[z-FIBT]{FIBT}{Focussed Ion Beam Tomography} (FIB-T) to investigate the effect of these issues on the emission of III-nitride nanobeam cavities.

\subsection{Crystal Structure}
\label{section1.1.1}

GaN can crystallise into two distinct crystal structures: hexagonal (wurtzite) and cubic (zinc blende and rock salt). Under ambient conditions, wurtzite GaN is the most commonly studied form as it is the most structurally stable. Thus, the work discussed in this thesis concerns wurtzite III-nitrides. A schematic of a wurtzite III-nitride crystal structure is shown in Fig.\ref{1.1} and consists of stacked hexagonal close-packed planes following an ABABAB stacking sequence. Atoms of the respective elements are tetrahedrally bonded to one another. However, in the case of III-nitrides this structure deviates from ideal tetrahedral bonding and results in a non-zero dipole moment for each unit cell which will be discussed in the following sections.
\\ A 4-index Miller-Bravais notation (hkil) is used to denote the crystal planes where the index {\it i} is defined by the relation:

\begin{equation}
 i = -(h+k)
 \end{equation}
\\
 
The crystallographic planes (0001), (1-100) and (11-20) shown in Fig.\ref{1.1} are often termed the {\it c}, {\it m} and {\it a}-planes in the literature. The fundamental unit cell of the wurtzite GaN crystal structure and its associated lattice parameters \textbf{a} and \textbf{c} is shown in Fig.\ref{1.2}

Other members of the III-nitride materials such as indium nitride \nomenclature[z-InN]{InN}{Indium Nitride} (InN) or aluminium nitride \nomenclature[z-AlN]{AlN}{Aluminium Nitride} (AlN) have different lattice parameters due to the differing atomic radii of aluminium and indium relative to gallium.

		\hline
	\end{tabular}

\end{table}

III-nitride photonic devices are often heterostructures consisting of ternary alloys the materials shown in Table~\ref{tab1.1}. Lattice parameters of a relaxed ternary alloy $A_{x}B_{1-x}N$ can be estimated using Vegard's law \cite{Vickers2003}:

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{a} = x \mathbf{a}_{AN} + (1-x)\mathbf{a}_{BN}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\mathbf{c} = x \mathbf{c}_{AN} + (1-x)\mathbf{c}_{BN}
\end{equation}

Typical indium compositions for blue LEDs range between 15-20 $\%$, which leads to a considerable lattice mismatch of approximately 2 $\%$, resulting in considerable amounts of strain in these GaN/InGaN heterostructures.

\subsection{Band Structure} 
\label{section1.1.2}

One of the principal driving factors behind the interest in III-nitrides for photonic devices is their direct bandgap which collectively spans the visible spectrum and beyond.


\subsection{Built-in Fields} 
\label{section1.1.3}
III-nitride materials in wurtzite structure are termed 'polar' materials, due to the fact they exhibit a spontaneous polarisation field \cite{Ambacher2002}. This occurs due to III-nitride bonding structure deviating from an ideal tetrahedral structure along the (0001) axis along the crystal, combined with the ionicity of the bond \cite{Ren2015}. This deviation causes each unit cell to possess a non-zero dipole moment along the principal axis of the tetrahedral bonding structure, resulting in an overall spontaneous polarization in the crystal. As the III-nitride wurtzite structure is non-centrosymmetric, the direction of the polarization depends on whether the crystal exhibits (+ {\it c}) or (-{\it c}) polarity, as shown in Fig.\ref{1.3}
