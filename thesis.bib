Atomic force microscopy revealed that their dimensions were small enough to expect zero-dimensional quantum effects: the islands were typically 27 nm wide and 2.9 nm high. Strong blue-violet photoluminescence of the dots is observed, persisting up to room temperature. The temperature dependence of the photoluminescence is analyzed and compared to that of InGaN quantum well and bulk samples.},

The image quality obtained by many current algorithms is seriously affected by the problems of missing wedge artefacts and non-linear projection intensities due to diffraction effects. The former refers to the fact that data cannot be acquired over the full 180° tilt range; the latter implies that for some orientations, crystalline structures can show strong contrast changes. To overcome these problems we introduce and discuss several algorithms from the mathematical fields of geometric and discrete tomography. The algorithms incorporate geometric prior knowledge (mainly convexity and homogeneity), which also in principle considerably reduces the number of tilt angles required. Results are discussed for the reconstruction of an InAs nanowire. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Cross-section transmission electron microscopy reveals varying shapes and lateral sizes in the range ∼1-5 nm of the QD-like features, while scanning near field optical microscopy demonstrates a highly inhomogeneous spatial distribution of optically active individual localization centers. Microphotoluminescence spectroscopy confirms the spectrally inhomogeneous distribution of localization centers, in which the exciton and the biexciton related emissions from single centers of varying geometry could be identified by means of excitation power dependencies. Interestingly, the biexciton binding energy (E(b)xx) was found to vary from center to center, between 3 to -22 meV, in correlation with the exciton emission energy. Negative binding energies are only justified by a three-dimensional quantum confinement, which confirms QD-like properties of the localization centers. The observed energy correlation is proposed to be understood as variations of the lateral extension of the confinement potential, which would yield smaller values of E(b)xx for reduced lateral extension and higher exciton emission energy. The proposed relation between lateral extension and E(b)xx is further supported by the exciton and the biexciton recombination lifetimes of a single QD, which suggest a lateral extension of merely ∼3 nm for a QD with strongly negative E(b)xx = -15.5 meV.},

Significant achievements have been made in developing III-nitride NW lasers with emission wavelengths from the deep ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared spectral range. The types of lasers under investigation include Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot, photonic crystal, plasmonic, ring resonator, microstadium, random, polariton, and two-dimensional distributed feedback lasers. The lasing thresholds vary by several orders of magnitude, which are a direct consequence of differing NW dimensions, quality of the NWs, characteristics of NW cavities, and coupling with the substrate. For electrically injected, such as ultralow-threshold and continuous-wave III-nitride NW lasers that can operate at room temperature, the following obstacles remain: carrier loss mechanisms including defect-related nonradiative surface recombination, electron overflow, and poor hole transport; low radiative recombination efficiency and high surface recombination; poor thermal management; and highly resistive ohmic contacts on the p-layer. These obstacles must be overcome to fully realize the potential of these lasers.},

  abstract =        {Direct epitaxial growth of inorganic compound semiconductors on lattice-matched single-crystal substrates has provided an important way to fabricate light sources for various applications including lighting, displays and optical communications. Nevertheless, unconventional substrates such as silicon, amorphous glass, plastics, and metals must be used for emerging optoelectronic applications, such as high-speed photonic circuitry and flexible displays. However, high-quality film growth requires good matching of lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between the film and the supporting substrate. This restricts monolithic fabrication of optoelectronic devices on unconventional substrates. Here, we describe methods to grow high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) microdisks on amorphous silicon oxide layers formed on silicon using micropatterned graphene films as a nucleation layer. Highly crystalline GaN microdisks having hexagonal facets were grown on graphene dots with intermediate ZnO nanowalls via epitaxial lateral overgrowth. Furthermore, whispering-gallery-mode lasing from the GaN microdisk with a Q-factor of 1200 was observed at room temperature.},

In the first step, the selective area epitaxy proceeds at low temperature and GaN stripes with a triangular cross section are rapidly obtained. Then, in a second step, these stripes are used as seeds for epitaxial lateral overgrowth, the growth conditions being changed either by increasing the growth temperature or by introducing a Mg precursor. Fully coalesced and planar GaN samples are: thereby achieved. A comparison between samples grown without and with this two-step process evidences an additional reduction in the threading defects density with the two-step process. The dislocations emerging from the seeds are drastically reduced to 5 x 10(6) to 10(7) cm(-2) between the coalescence boundaries.},

Yet there are barriers to making high efficiency GaN based devices: defects, including threading dislocations (TDs), hamper the quality of the GaN crystalline film. The hypotheses proposed to explain the origin of TDs are critically reviewed. It has been suggested that TDs form upon GaN island coalescence during initial stages of crystalline film growth, yet some transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies have shown few TDs at coalescence boundaries. Although harmful, TDs have a lesser effect on nitride based devices than on other compound semiconductors. Thus, GaN based devices are able to produce light despite high dislocation densities. This phenomenon has led to debate over the role of TDs in charge carrier recombination, which is reviewed. Some suggest that charge carriers arrive at TDs and recombine in a non-radiative manner, whereas others claim that they are repelled from the dislocations because the dislocation cores are electrically charged. The reduction of TDs in GaN films furthers the drive towards high efficiency devices. The final sections of this review address ways to effect reductions in TD density. Methods include changing growth conditions (including temperature and pressure), dosing the substrate with silane, and the exploitation of interlayers deposited during growth.},

We present an efficient algorithm for the two-dimensional design of wavelength-selective filters based on waveguide-coupled whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonators of arbitrary cross-sectional shape. A full-wave integral equation formulation enables us to accurately account for the coupling between the resonator and bus waveguide as well as for radiation and material losses. Furthermore, we apply this approach to the analysis of elliptic-resonator filters. Filter tuning by changing the resonator shape from circular to elliptic reduces the dependence of the coupling efficiency on the width of the air gap. Two alternative coupling designs are suggested for monolithic and hybrid integration technologies. One is based on increasing the coupling length, while the other exploits the field concentration at the increased-curvature portion of the deformed WGM resonator.},

It is well known that chemical etching solutions such as KOH, H 2SO4 and H3PO4, to selectively etch the N-face GaN but not the Ga-face GaN. In this study, the N-face GaN was exposed around the chip by laser scribing at the GaN/sapphire interface. These channels provided paths for the chemical etchant to flow and allow the etching solution to further contact with and etch the exposed bottom N-face GaN. Chemical etching of the chip sidewalls formed the inverted hexagonal pyramid shape with {\{}10 -1 -1{\}} facets. Findings show that inverted pyramid sidewalls enhance 20 mA LED output power by 27{\%} for LEDs, with chemical etching of the chip sidewalls for 4 min, compared to the conventional LED. The larger LED output power is attributed to increased light extraction efficiency by inverted pyramid sidewalls. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A direct correlation of CL maps with TEM has been established, showing that threading edge dislocations act as nonradiative recombination centers with an associated minority carrier diffusion length of 200 nm. Threading dislocations of screw and mixed type were found to be associated with surface pits which were also nonradiative in the quantum well (QW) emission, but owing to the absence of QW growth on the pit facets. The contributions of edge and screw/mixed dislocations to the reduction of the QW emission are quantified, and the wider significance of these results is discussed.

Remarkably, InGaN blue- and green-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit brilliant light although the threading dislocation density generated due to lattice mismatch is six orders of magnitude higher than that in conventional LEDs. Here we explain why In-containing (Al,In,Ga)N bulk films exhibit a defect-insensitive emission probability. From the extremely short positron diffusion lengths ({\textless}4 nm) and short radiative lifetimes of excitonic emissions, we conclude that localizing valence states associated with atomic condensates of In-N preferentially capture holes, which have a positive charge similar to positrons. The holes form localized excitons to emit the light, although some of the excitons recombine at non-radiative centres. The enterprising use of atomically inhomogeneous crystals is proposed for future innovation in light emitters even when using defective crystals.},

We observed anomalous emission behavior, specifically an /b S-shaped/ (decrease-increase-decrease) temperature dependence of the peak energy (E/sub p/) for InGaN-related PL with increasing temperature: E/sub p/ redshifts in the temperature range of 10-70 K, blueshifts for 70-150 K, and redshifts again for 150-300 K with increasing temperature. In addition, when E/sub p/ redshifts, the spectral width is observed to narrow, while when E/sub p/ blueshifts, it broadens. From a study of the integrated PL intensity as a function of temperature, it is found that thermionic emission of photocarriers out of local potential minima into higher energy states within the wells is the dominant mechanism leading to the thermal quenching of the InGaN-related PL. We demonstrate that the temperature-induced S-shaped PL shift is caused by a change in the carrier dynamics with increasing temperature due to inhomogeneity and carrier localization in the InGaN/GaN MQWs},

From cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, we found that all V defects are not always connected with TDs at their bottom. By increasing the indium composition in the InxGa1-xN well layer or decreasing the TD density of the thick GaN layer, many V defects are generated from the stacking mismatch boundaries induced by stacking faults which are formed within the MQW due to the strain relaxation. Also, TD density in the thick GaN layer affects not only the origin of V-defect formation but also the critical indium composition of the InxGa1-xN well on the formation of V defects.},

For quantum information processing and metrology applications, a non-classical emitter of single photons is required. A single quantum dot is an ideal source of single photons and such single-photon sources in the visible spectral range have been demonstrated with III-nitride and II-VI-based single quantum dots. It has been suggested that short-wavelength blue single-photon emitters would be useful for free-space quantum cryptography, with the availability of high-speed single-photon detectors in this spectral region. Here we demonstrate blue single-photon emission with electrical injection from an In0.25Ga0.75N quantum dot in a single nanowire. The emitted single photons are linearly polarized along the c axis of the nanowire with a degree of linear polarization of {\~{}}70{\%}.},

We focus on the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip in the photon coincidence rate which provides a direct measure of interference of indistinguishable photons linked to their Bose statistics. The effect has been first observed with entangled photons generated by parametric down conversion and then extended to independent emitters. Fluctuations caused by coupling between emitters and a bath can erode the interference which causes the dip. Here we show how the magnitude and shape of the HOM dip is affected by spectral diffusion induced by coupling to a brownian oscillator bath. Conditions for maintaining and controlling the interference are specified.},

However, their physical interpretations have not been well discussed yet. Based on wavelength-dependent and temperature-varying time-resolved PL measurements, the mechanism of carrier transport among different levels of localized states (spatially distributed) in such an indium aggregated structure was proposed for interpreting the early-stage fast decay, delayed slow rise, and extended slow decay of PL intensity. Three samples of the same quantum well geometry but different nominal indium contents, and hence different degrees of indium aggregation and carrier localization, were compared. The process of carrier transport was enhanced with a certain amount of thermal energy for overcoming potential barriers between spatially distributed potential minimums. In samples of higher indium contents, more complicated carrier localization potential structures led to enhanced carrier transport activities. Free exciton behaviors of the three samples at high temperatures are consistent with previously reported transmission electron microscopy results},

  abstract =        {Despite the high density of threading dislocations generally found in (AlGaIn)N heterostructures, the light emission efficiency of such structures is exceptionally high. It has become common to attribute the high efficiency to compositional fluctuations or even phase separation in the active GaInN quantum well region. The resulting localization of charge carriers is thought to keep them from recombining nonradiatively at the defects. Here, we show that random disorder is not the key but that under suitable growth conditions hexagonal V-shaped pits decorating the defects exhibit narrow sidewall quantum wells with an effective band gap significantly larger than that of the regular c-plane quantum wells. Thereby nature provides a unique, hitherto unrecognized mechanism generating a potential landscape which effectively screens the defects themselves by providing an energy barrier around every defect.},

The diameter and height of the fabricated InGaN QDs an estimated to be similar to 10 nm and similar to 5 nm, respectively, by an atomic-force microscope (AFM). Indium mole fraction of InxGa1-xN QDs is controlled from x = similar to 0.22 to similar to 0.52 by varying the growth temperature of QDs. Intense photoluminescence is observed even at room temperature from InGaN QDs embedded with the GaN capping layers.

  abstract =        {Three-dimensional (3D) data represent the basis for reliable quantification of complex microstructures. Therefore, the development of high-resolution tomography techniques is of major importance for many materials science disciplines. In this paper, we present a novel serial sectioning procedure for 3D analysis using a dual-beam FIB (focused ion beam). A very narrow and reproducible spacing between the individual imaging planes is achieved by using drift correction algorithms in the automated slicing procedure. The spacing between the planes is nearly of the same magnitude as the pixel resolution on scanning electron microscopy images. Consequently, the acquired stack of images can be transformed directly into a 3D data volume with a voxel resolution of 6 x 7 x 17 nm. To demonstrate the capabilities of FIB nanotomography, a BaTiO3 ceramic with a high volume fraction of fine porosity was investigated using the method as a basis for computational microstructure analysis and the results compared with conventional physical measurements. Significant differences between the particle size distributions as measured by nanotomography and laser granulometry indicate that the latter analysis is skewed by particle agglomeration/aggregation in the raw powder and by uncertainties related to calculation assumptions. Significant differences are also observed between the results from mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and 3D pore space analysis. There is strong evidence that the ink-bottle effect leads to an overestimation of the frequency of small pores in MIP. FIB nanotomography thus reveals quantitative information of structural features smaller than 100 nm in size which cannot be acquired easily by other methods.},

Tunable QD emission energy by varying the growth temperature of the InGaN layers is also demonstrated. From $\mu$PL, it is evident that the QDs are located in the apexes of the pyramids. The fact that the emission lines of the QDs are linear polarized in a preferred direction implies that the apexes induce unidirected anisotropic fields to the QDs. The single emission lines remain unchanged with increasing the excitation power and/or crystal temperature. An in-plane elongated QD forming a shallow potential with an equal number of trapped electrons and holes is proposed to explain the absence of other exciton complexes.},

Here, we develop a new design concept for three-dimensional waveguides and bends, and realize it exper- imentally in silicon three-dimensional photonic crystals. We demonstrate clear three-dimensional optical guiding phenom- ena, in which light is incident on the crystal from one side, is bent vertically and horizontally (and is even split into two or trapped by an intermediate nanocavity), and is finally emitted from the other side of the crystal. These results will open the door to the realization of three-dimensional optical chips with various functionalities.},

  abstract =        {The great success that GaN-based structures have enjoyed in implementing efficient optoelectronic devices has fostered a rapidly expanding interest amongst researchers aimed at understanding their underlying physics. There has been an active debate on the mechanisms that give rise to efficient luminescence in these materials. In this paper we approach these questions through optical studies of single InGaN/GaN quantum dots in the context of the available experimental and theoretical understanding of InGaN structures in general, and of three-dimensional localization in this material in particular. We will also show how it is possible to exploit the various unique properties that nitride-based materials offer, such as the strong inbuilt electric field, in a controlled manner. Such control may in the future prove essential for the implementation of single quantum dot devices in applications such as quantum information processing. We also show how nonlinear spectroscopy provides an invaluable tool in suppressing background luminescence effects inherent in this material.},

Gallium nitride (GaN) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of much practical interest, because it is widely used in electrically pumped ultraviolet-blue light-emitting diodes, lasers and photodetectors. Recent progress in microfabrication techniques has allowed stimulated emission to be observed from a variety of GaN microstructures and films. Here we report the observation of ultraviolet-blue laser action in single monocrystalline GaN nanowires, using both near-field and far-field optical microscopy to characterize the waveguide mode structure and spectral properties of the radiation at room temperature. The optical microscope images reveal radiation patterns that correlate with axial Fabry-Perot modes (Q approximately 10(3)) observed in the laser spectrum, which result from the cylindrical cavity geometry of the monocrystalline nanowires. A redshift that is strongly dependent on pump power (45 meV microJ x cm(-2)) supports the idea that the electron-hole plasma mechanism is primarily responsible for the gain at room temperature. This study is a considerable advance towards the realization of electron-injected, nanowire-based ultraviolet-blue coherent light sources.},

With increasing excitation power, an additional peak emerges in the higher-energy side of an excitonic ground state.

Semiconductor quantum-dot structures have recently shown great promise as practical single-photon sources, and devices with integrated optical cavities and electrical-carrier injection have already been demonstrated. However, a significant obstacle for the application of commonly used III-V quantum dots to quantum-information-processing schemes is the requirement of liquid-helium cryogenic temperatures. Epitaxially grown gallium nitride quantum dots embedded in aluminium nitride have the potential for operation at much higher temperatures. Here, we report triggered single-photon emission from gallium nitride quantum dots at temperatures up to 200 K, a temperature easily reachable with thermo-electric cooling. Gallium nitride quantum dots also open a new wavelength region in the blue and near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum for single-photon sources.},

In order to achieve such an ideal experimental condition for the TEMT, improvements in the specimen as well as the sample holder were made. A rod-shaped specimen was necessary in order to obtain a high transmission of the specimen upon tilting to large angles. The image resolution of the reconstructed tomogram was isotropic, in sharp contrast to the anisotropic image resolution of the conventional TEMT with a limited angular range (the "missing wedge" problem). A volume fraction of zirconia, $\phi$, evaluated from the 3D reconstruction was in quantitative agreement with the known composition of the nanocomposite. A series of 3D reconstructions was made from the tilt series with complete rotation by limiting the maximum tilt angle, $\alpha$, from which a couple of structural parameters, the volume fraction and surface area per unit volume, $\Sigma$, of the zirconia, were evaluated as a function of $\alpha$. It was confirmed from actual experimental data that both $\phi$ and $\Sigma$ slightly decreased with the increasing $\alpha$ and reached constant values at around $\alpha$ = 80 °, suggesting that the specimen may have to be tilted to ±80° for truly quantitative measurements. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Nonresonant pulsed excitation results in a broad PL peak, while resonant excitation into the nonresonant PL intensity maximum results in an evolution of a sharp resonant PL peak, having a spectral shape defined by the excitation laser pulse and a radiative decay time close to that revealed for PL under nonresonant excitation. Observation of a resonantly excited narrow PL line gives clear proof of the quantum dot nature of luminescence in InGaN-GaN samples. PL decay demonstrates strongly nonexponential behavior evidencing coexistence of quantum dots having similar ground-state transition energy, but very different electron-hole wave-function overlap.},

This technique proved to be efficient in realizing practically damage-free etching, hence preventing the deterioration of the nanostructure's crystal quality. The density, size, and positions of the nanostructures could be well designed and controlled using the above process.

  abstract =        {Basal-plane stacking faults are an important class of optically active structural defects in wurtzite semiconductors. The local deviation from the 2H stacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound state in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of excitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking faults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons with characteristic energies. Luminescence spectroscopy is thus capable of detecting even a single stacking fault in an otherwise perfect wurtzite crystal. This review draws a comprehensive picture of the luminescence properties related to stacking faults in GaN. The emission energies associated with different types of stacking faults as well as factors that can shift these energies are discussed. In this context, the importance of the quantum-confined Stark effect in these zinc-blende/wurtzite heterostructures, which results from the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite GaN, is underlined. This discussion is extended to zinc-blende segments in a wurtzite matrix. Furthermore, other factors affecting the emission energy and linewidth of stacking fault-related peaks as well as results obtained at room temperature are addressed. The considerations presented in this article should be transferable also to other wurtzite semiconductors.},

We propose two approaches fully compatible with planar fabrication, which allow to increase the cavity Q's by several orders of magnitude while keeping constant the mode volume V of the cavity. The first approach consists of engineering the mirror to taper the guided mode into the mirror Bloch mode, thus decreasing losses. The second approach is less intuitive and relies on a recycling mechanism of the radiation losses. The study is supported by computational results obtained for two-dimensional silicon-on-insulator geometries, but the results apply as well to other related geometries like three-dimensional photonic-wire cavities.},

It is found that the density and averaged size of V-defects increases with QB thickness, resulting in larger reverse- and forward-bias current in LEDs. Electroluminescence measurement shows that LED with thinner QB has higher internal quantum efficiency but lower efficiency droop-onset current density, which should be ascribed to the faster saturation of carrier leakage into V-defects. Correspondingly, above the droop-onset current density, severer Auger recombination and carrier overflow are induced by higher carrier density due to the less V-defect related carrier leakage, leading to the more serious droop phenomenon in LEDs with thinner QB.},

  abstract =        {Nowadays, tomography plays a central role in pureand applied science, in medicine, and in many branches of engineering and technology. It entails reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) structure of an object from a tilt series of two-dimensional (2D) images. Its origin goes back to 1917, when Radon showed mathematically how a series of 2D projection images could be converted to the 3D structural one. Tomographic X-ray and positron scanning for 3D medical imaging, with a resolution of ∼1 mm, is now ubiquitous in major hospitals. Electron tomography, a relatively new chemical tool, with a resolution of ∼1 nm, has been recently adopted by materials chemists as an invaluable aid for the 3D study of the morphologies, spatially-discriminating chemical compositions, and defect properties of nanostructured materials. In this Account, we review the advances that have been made in facilitating the recording of the required series of 2D electron microscopic images and the subsequent process of 3D reconstruction of specimens that are vulnerable, to a greater or lesser degree, to electron beam damage. We describe how high-fidelity 3D tomograms may be obtained from relatively few 2D images by incorporating prior structural knowledge into the reconstruction process. In particular, we highlight the vital role of compressed sensing, a recently developed procedure well-known to information theorists that exploits ideas of image compression and "sparsity" (that the important image information can be captured in a reduced data set). We also touch upon another promising approach, "discrete" tomography, which builds into the reconstruction process a prior assumption that the object can be described in discrete terms, such as the number of constituent materials and their expected densities. Other advances made recently that we outline, such as the availability of aberration-corrected electron microscopes, electron wavelength monochromators, and sophisticated specimen goniometers, have all contributed significantly to the further development of quantitative 3D studies of nanostructured materials, including nanoparticle-heterogeneous catalysts, fuel-cell components, and drug-delivery systems, as well as photovoltaic and plasmonic devices, and are likely to enhance our knowledge of many other facets of materials chemistry, such as organic-inorganic composites, solar-energy devices, bionanotechnology, biomineralization, and energy-storage systems composed of high-permittivity metal oxides.},

Here, we report that defect-free disordered AlGaN core-shell nanowire arrays, formed directly on a Si substrate, can be used to achieve highly stable, electrically pumped lasers across the entire ultraviolet AII (UV-AII) band (∼320-340 nm) at low temperatures. The laser threshold is in the range of tens of amps per centimetre squared, which is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than those of previously reported quantum-well lasers. This work also reports the first demonstration of electrically injected AlGaN-based ultraviolet lasers monolithically grown on a Si substrate, and offers a new avenue for achieving semiconductor lasers in the ultraviolet B (UV-B) (280-320 nm) and ultraviolet C (UV-C) ({\textless}280 nm) bands.},

Our calculated absorption and emission lines also indicate that is a likely source for the yellow luminescence that is frequently observed in GaN, solving the longstanding puzzle of the nature of the C-related defect involved in yellow emission. Our results suggest that previous experimental data, analyzed under the assumption that acts as a shallow acceptor, should be re-examined.},

The integrated PL intensity of QDs sample shows a dramatic increase in a temperature range from 160 K to 215 K and reaches the maximum value at 215 K instead of 10 K as usual. To interpret this phenomenon, a theoretic model of temperature induced carrier redistribution mechanism is designed using rate equation, which fits closely with the experimental result. It is concluded that carriers' redistribution from shallow QDs or wetting layer to deep QDs gives rise to the unique behavior for InGaNQDs structure.},

Microdisks, approximately 9 mu m in diameter and regularly spaced every 50 mu m, were formed by an ion beam etch process, Individual disks were pumped at 300 and 10 K with 290 nm laser pulses focused to a spot size much smaller than the disk diameter, Optical modes corresponding to (i) the radial mode type with a spacing of 49-51 meV (both TE and TM) and (ii) the Whispering Gallery mode With a spacing of 15-16 meV were observed in the GaN microdisk cavities. The spacings of these modes are consistent with those expected for modes within a resonant cavity of cylindrical symmetry, refractive index, and dimensions of the microdisks under investigation, The GaN-based microdisk cavity is compared with its GaAs counterpart and implications regarding future GaN-based microdisk lasers are discussed.

The kinetic blocking of polariton relaxation that prevents formation of the Bose-condensed phase of polaritons at low temperatures disappears at high temperatures, especially in n-doped samples. Thus, GaN microcavities are excellent candidates for realization of room-temperature polariton lasers.},

The PL measurements show a large number of high Q factor resonant modes on the whole spectrum, which allows us to identify the different radial mode families and to compare them with simulations. We report a considerable improvement of the Q factor, which reflects the etching quality and the relatively low cavity loss by inserting QDs into the cavity. GaN/AlN QDs-based $\mu$-disks show very high Q values (Q{\textgreater}7000) whereas the Q factor is only up to 2000 in $\mu$-disks embedding QDs grown on the AlGaN barrier layer. We attribute this difference to the lower absorption below bandgap for AlN barrier layers at the energies of our experimental investigation.},

Good structural, electrical, and optical properties were obtained for undoped and n-type doped AlGaN alloys on (0001)-oriented sapphire substrates. A typical full width at half maximum of 670–800 arc s is measured for the (0002) x-ray double-diffraction peak in the $\omega$ mode of 1-$\mu$m-thick AlGaN epilayers grown on a GaN nucleation layer. Room-temperature electron mobilities up to 90 cm2/V s are measured on n-type (10 18   cm −3 ) AlGaN epilayers. The low-temperature photoluminescence (T=9  K ) performed on nonintentionally doped AlGaN epilayers with low-Al content (10{\%} and 14{\%}) exhibits reproducibly a sharp exciton-related peak, associated with two phonon replica and does not exhibit any low-photon energy transitions. Optical transmission as well as absorption coefficient measurements using photothermal deflection spectroscopy have been used to study the variation of the T=300  K energy gap of AlGaN with the aluminum concentration. Visible-blind AlGaN(Si)-based photoconductors and Schottky barrier photodiodes with good operating characteristics have been fabricated with these materials.},

  abstract =        {By the use of the electron beam plasma technique, it has been found that the solid solutions of Ga1−x In x N can be synthesized over the entire composition region. From the optical measurements, the direct energy gap at 78 °K was determined to be 3.46 eV for GaN and 2.11 eV for InN. Also its composition dependence was found to deviate downward from linearity. From the infrared reflectivity measurement and the resultant K‐K dispersion analysis, the transverse optical frequencies for long‐wavelength phonons of GaN and InN were 563 and 478 cm−1, respectively. The optical phonons in this quasibinary system were concluded to exhibit a one‐mode–type behavior. The Brout sum rule was discussed for a large number of the diatomic crystals of A N B 8−N type and its relation with respect to the reduced mass was derived as $\Sigma$ i $\omega$2 i (k=0) =A $\mu$−1.5. According to this relation, the longitudinal optical frequency of InN was deduced to be 694 cm−1. On the other hand, from the result of the annealing treatment for the solid‐solution alloys and the theoretical consideration, it was pointed out that this quasibinary system has a solid‐phase misibility gap in chemical equilibrium.},

Based on the results of recent theoretical calculations it is suggested that these traps could be gallium vacancies VGa and that the centers responsible for yellow luminescence are formed by pairing such vacancies with shallow donors. The results indicate that the yellow luminescence band could be the dominant recombination channel in the samples with strong yellow luminescence band whereas in the samples with weak yellow luminescence recombination this role is taken over by nonradiative recombination centers. Deep levels transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements revealed the existence of a barrier for capture of electrons for electron traps at Ec−0.55eV (0.15eV) and Ec−0.8eV (about 0.35eV) and a possible role of such traps in persistent photoconductivity at room temperature in n-GaN is discussed.},

For example, Ge/Si core/shell nanowires have exhibited substantially higher performance as field-effect transistors and low-temperature quantum devices compared with homogeneous materials, and nano-roughened Si nanowires were recently shown to have an unusually high thermoelectric figure of merit. Here, we report the first multi-quantum-well (MQW) core/shell nanowire heterostructures based on well-defined III-nitride materials that enable lasing over a broad range of wavelengths at room temperature. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that the triangular GaN nanowire cores enable epitaxial and dislocation-free growth of highly uniform (InGaN/GaN)n quantum wells with n=3, 13 and 26 and InGaN well thicknesses of 1-3 nm. Optical excitation of individual MQW nanowire structures yielded lasing with InGaN quantum-well composition-dependent emission from 365 to 494 nm, and threshold dependent on quantum well number, n. Our work demonstrates a new level of complexity in nanowire structures, which potentially can yield free-standing injection nanolasers.},

  abstract =        {We report on an investigation of the optical properties of GaN quantum dots (QDs) grown by means of metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy. The growth regime for GaN on AlxGa1-xN was observed to change from two- to three-dimensional, forming GaN QDs, when Si was deposited on the AlxGa1-xN surface prior to the GaN growth. These QDs showed a redshift of the photo luminescence (PL) energy from the increased Coulomb energy induced by a compression of the exciton Bohr radius. Furthermore, a diminishing temperature-dependent shift of the PL energy with decreasing QD size caused by a reduction of the longitudinal-optical phonon coupling was found. We also show that the size of the QDs is a critical parameter for the optical nonlinearities. For large dots, the dominant nonlinearity in the PL is the bandgap renormalization but when the size of the dots was reduced below the critical size of 10 nm thick and 30 nm diameter, the state-filling effect became dominant.

  abstract =        {Cavity quantum electrodynamics, a central research field in optics and solid-state physics, addresses properties of atom-like emitters in cavities and can be divided into a weak and a strong coupling regime. For weak coupling, the spontaneous emission can be enhanced or reduced compared with its vacuum level by tuning discrete cavity modes in and out of resonance with the emitter. However, the most striking change of emission properties occurs when the conditions for strong coupling are fulfilled. In this case there is a change from the usual irreversible spontaneous emission to a reversible exchange of energy between the emitter and the cavity mode. This coherent coupling may provide a basis for future applications in quantum information processing or schemes for coherent control. Until now, strong coupling of individual two-level systems has been observed only for atoms in large cavities. Here we report the observation of strong coupling of a single two-level solid-state system with a photon, as realized by a single quantum dot in a semiconductor microcavity. The strong coupling is manifest in photoluminescence data that display anti-crossings between the quantum dot exciton and cavity-mode dispersion relations, characterized by a vacuum Rabi splitting of about 140 microeV.},

  abstract =        {Gallium nitride (GaN) and its allied binaries InN and AIN as well as their ternary compounds have gained an unprecedented attention due to their wide-ranging applications encompassing green, blue, violet, and ultraviolet (UV) emitters and detectors (in photon ranges inaccessible by other semiconductors) and high-power amplifiers. However, even the best of the three binaries, GaN, contains many structural and point defects caused to a large extent by lattice and stacking mismatch with substrates. These defects notably affect the electrical and optical properties of the host material and can seriously degrade the performance and reliability of devices made based on these nitride semiconductors. Even though GaN broke the long-standing paradigm that high density of dislocations precludes acceptable device performance, point defects have taken the center stage as they exacerbate efforts to increase the efficiency of emitters, increase laser operation lifetime, and lead to anomalies in electronic devices. The point defects include native isolated defects (vacancies, interstitial, and antisites), intentional or unintentional impurities, as well as complexes involving different combinations of the isolated defects. Further improvements in device performance and longevity hinge on an in-depth understanding of point defects and their reduction. In this review a comprehensive and critical analysis of point defects in GaN, particularly their manifestation in luminescence, is presented. In addition to a comprehensive analysis of native point defects, the signatures of intentionally and unintentionally introduced impurities are addressed. The review discusses in detail the characteristics and the origin of the major luminescence bands including the ultraviolet, blue, green, yellow, and red bands in undoped GaN. The effects of important group-II impurities, such as Zn and Mg on the photoluminescence of GaN, are treated in detail. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, the effects of other impurities, such as C, Si, H, O, Be, Mn, Cd, etc., on the luminescence properties of GaN are also reviewed. Further, atypical luminescence lines which are tentatively attributed to the surface and structural defects are discussed. The effect of surfaces and surface preparation, particularly wet and dry etching, exposure to UV light in vacuum or controlled gas ambient, annealing, and ion implantation on the characteristics of the defect-related emissions is described.

  abstract =        {Sub-band-gap absorption of GaN grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire was investigated by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), transmission measurements, and the constant photocurrent method (CPM). We determine acceptor binding energies in undoped GaN at 220 and about 720 meV. A comparison between absorption and CPM spectra yields the dependence of the quantum efficiency-mobility-lifetime-product ($\eta$$\mu$$\tau$) versus energy and gives relevant information about the excitation mechanisms. CPM spectra show a significantly smaller absorption (up to a factor of 1/10) in the range between 3.0 and 3.3 eV as compared to PDS. This indicates that the majority of carriers excited with these photon energies have a relatively small $\eta$$\mu$$\tau$ product and thus do not contribute to the externally detected photocurrent. We propose that in this energy range the spectrum is dominated by interband absorption in isolated cubic-phase crystallites in the hexagonal matrix and by excitation of electrons from occupied acceptors into the conduction band of the main hexagonal crystal modification (h-GaN). Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements, excited with energies below and above the direct band gap of hexagonal GaN, confirm this interpretation and can be correlated with the subgap absorption detected by PDS. Transient photocurrent measurements show a persistent photoconductivity, which can also be explained by the existence of isolated cubic-phase inclusions.},

  abstract =        {Cavity polaritons, the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor microcavities, may be understood as a superposition of excitons and cavity photons. Owing to their composite nature, these bosonic particles have a distinct optical response, at the same time very fast and highly nonlinear. Very efficient light amplification due to polariton-polariton parametric scattering has recently been reported in semiconductor microcavities at liquid-helium temperatures. Here we demonstrate polariton parametric amplification up to 120 K in GaAlAs-based microcavities and up to 220 K in CdTe-based microcavities. We show that the cut-off temperature for the amplification is ultimately determined by the binding energy of the exciton. A 5-micrometer-thick planar microcavity can amplify a weak light pulse more than 5,000 times. The effective gain coefficient of an equivalent homogeneous medium would be 107 cm-1. The subpicosecond duration and high efficiency of the amplification could be exploited for high-repetition all-optical microscopic switches and amplifiers. 105 polaritons occupy the same quantum state during the amplification, realizing a dynamical condensate of strongly interacting bosons which can be studied at high temperature.},

  abstract =        {We have investigated the regions around deep-pits and their limitations on the performance of metal-organic chemical vapor depositiongrown AlGaN/GaN high-electron-mobility transistors(HEMTs) on Si. The device characteristics such as maximum drain current density ( I DSmax ) , threshold voltage ( V th ) , and three terminal-OFF breakdown ( B V OFF ) of a HEMT were affected based on the distance of deep-pits from a device active region. The deterioration of HEMTcharacteristics are significant if the active region is present within 50   $\mu$ m radius of a deep-pit and becomes insignificant for distance beyond 50   $\mu$ m . These device characteristics were compared with optical measurements and it was found the region around 50   $\mu$ m radius of a pit have large dislocations and defects as confirmed by cathodoluminescence. Further, the E 2 Raman shift measurements reveal additional stress in the 50   $\mu$ m region around a pit.},

The microcavity was formed by sandwiching indium gallium nitride multiple quantum wells between nitride-based and oxide-based quarter-wave reflectors. Lasing action was observed at a wavelength of 399 nanometers under optical excitation and confirmed by a narrowing of the linewidth in the emission spectra from 0.8 nanometer below threshold to less than 0.1 nanometer (resolution limit) above threshold. The result suggests that practical blue vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers can be realized in gallium-nitride-based material systems.},

The hole diffusion length in n-type GaN was estimated to be neighboring 50 nm by comparing the diameters of the dark spots in thick samples used for CL and samples that were thinned for TEM observation. The efficiency of light emission is high as long as the minority carrier diffusion length is shorter than the dislocation spacing.},

A set of conditions crucial to the polarity control of GaN is provided for each of the following growth techniques; molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Although GaN films might have been deposited by identical growth methods using the same buffer layer technologies, there is often a conflict between the resulting polarities achieved by different research groups. In this paper, we present the implications of the conditions used in each of the processes used for two-step metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), demonstrating systematic control of the polarity of GaN films on sapphire substrates. The potential for confusion in polarity control will be explained, taking into account the implications clarified in our studies. the correlation between the polarity and the growth conditions will be discussed in order to provide a mechanism for the determination and control of the crystal polarity during the growth of GaN films.},

Almost all of the threading dislocations that appear in the wing regions are a-type dislocations. Their origins are the lateral extension of dislocations from the seed regions that contingently bend upwards to the episurface. Comparing short-lived LDs and long-lived LDs that have almost the same power consumption, we find that the relative levels of dislocation densities in their respective active layers are different. In the degraded LDs, neither dislocation multiplication from the threading dislocations nor any structural changes of the threading dislocations are observed. This indicates that degradation is not caused by dislocation multiplication at the active layers, which is usually observed in LDs featuring zincblende-based structures. The degradation rate is almost proportional to the square root of the aging time. Our results indicate that degradation is governed by a diffusion process, and a detailed degradation mechanism is proposed.},

The thickness of the total repeat (an InGaN well plus a GaN barrier) in the superlattice is easily determined from the spacing between the satellite peaks in an omega/2theta scan. Measurement of the individual thickness of InGaN and GaN layers and the indium content is less straightforward, since for multilayerstructures the peak positions are influenced by both the indium content and the thickness ratio of the GaN to the InGaN layer. Thus, several different models may give reasonable fits to data collected over a limited range (about 1° omega/2theta either side of the (002)) showing only lower-order (−3 to +3) satellite peaks. Whenever possible, we have collected data over a wide range (about 4° omega/2theta) and determined the thickness ratio by examination of the relative intensities of weak higher-order satellite peaks (−7 to +5). An alternative but less sensitive method is to use relative intensities from x-rayreflectivity measurements to give the thickness ratio. Once the thickness of both the InGaN and GaN layers has been established, the InGaN composition can be determined from the peak positions. If the quality of the samples is poor, because of inhomogeneities or wide diffuse interfaces, there are insufficient data to characterize the structures. There is good agreement between the composition of the epilayer as determined by XRD and secondary ion mass spectroscopy and good agreement between x-ray and electron microscopy results for the quantum wellstructures. We find no variation from Vegard's rule for In contents less than 0.20.

For a quantum dot on resonance with the cavity, the spontaneous emission rate is increased by a factor of five, while the probability to emit two or more photons in the same pulse is reduced to 2{\%} compared to a Poisson-distributed source of the same intensity. In addition to the small multi-photon probability, such a strong Purcell effect is important in a single-photon source for improving the photon outcoupling efficiency and the single-photon generation rate, and for bringing the emitted photon pulses closer to the Fourier transform limit.},

The two main classes are: (1) “conventional” nitrides (wurtzite and zinc-blende GaN, InN, and AlN, along with their alloys) and (2) “dilute” nitrides (zinc-blende ternaries and quaternaries in which a relatively small fraction of N is added to a host III–V material, e.g., GaAsN and GaInAsN). As in our more general review of III–V semiconductor band parameters [I. Vurgaftman et al., J. Appl. Phys. 89, 5815 (2001)], complete and consistent parameter sets are recommended on the basis of a thorough and critical review of the existing literature. We tabulate the direct and indirect energy gaps, spin-orbit and crystal-field splittings, alloy bowing parameters, electron and hole effective masses, deformation potentials, elastic constants, piezoelectric and spontaneous polarization coefficients, as well as heterostructure band offsets. Temperature and alloy-composition dependences are also recommended wherever they are available. The “band anticrossing” model is employed to parameterize the fundamental band gap and conduction band properties of the dilute nitride materials.},

  abstract =        {InGaN quantum dots (QDs) have been formed by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition selective growth on Si-patterned GaN/sapphire substrates. The QDs were fabricated on GaN plinths grown within nanoscale circular windows opened in the Si mask by both focused ion-beam irradiation and photoassisted wet chemical etching. Using this process, the epitaxial growth of GaN plinths could be achieved on an underlying GaN layer spared from process-induced damage. The optical properties of the InGaN QDs have been investigated by low-temperature cathodoluminescence measurements. Compared to the band-gap emission from a reference sample of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells, the evident blueshift of the emission peak from the InGaN QDs was demonstrated. This result suggests that the carriers in the InGaN QDs were three-dimensionally confined. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0003-6951(99)03733-X].},

The quality factor of the cavity is approximately 860 with a threshold power density of 37.5 mJ/cm2. Such a device performance was attributed to the combination of metal-coated nanocavity with whispering-gallery modes. Moreover, the group index extracted from the experiment was 5.99 and was verified with calculations and analyses of the lasing modes as well as their characteristics.

We demonstrate how the large polarization field leads to a linear dependence of the exciton energy on dot size, provided the aspect ratio of the dot is conserved while the size is varied. We also present a useful analytical approximation for the electron and hole wave functions in nitride QDs in terms of Airy functions, which compares well with the solutions of a numerical computation. We note that the disagreement concerning the sign of the shear piezoelectric coefficient e/sub 15/ leads to a significant uncertainty in the calculated potential},

  abstract = {In the growth of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well(MQW) structures, a novel defect (called the “V-defect”) initiates at threading dislocations in one of the first quantum wells in a MQW stack. This defect is common to almost all InGaN MQWheterostructures. The nature of the V-defect was evaluated using transmission electron microscopy(TEM), scanning TEM(STEM), and low-temperature cathodoluminescence(CL) on a series of In 0.20 Ga 0.80 N/GaN MQW samples. The structure of the V-defect includes buried side-wall quantum wells (on the {\{}101̄1{\}} planes) and an open hexagonal inverted pyramid which is defined by the six {\{}101̄1{\}} planes. Thus, in cross section this defect appears as an open “V”. The formation of the V-defect is kinetically controlled by reduced Ga incorporation on the pyramid walls ({\{}101̄1{\}} planes). The V-defect is correlated with the localized excitonic recombination centers that give rise to a long-wavelength shoulder in photoluminescence(PL) and CL spectra. This long-wavelength shoulder has the following characteristics: (i) its intensity is correlated with the side-wall quantum wells; (ii) the temperature independence of the full width at half maximum strongly supports a localized exciton recombination process.}

Broad short-wavelength electroluminescence peak, which has strong relative intensity to the main emission, was found in the UID-EBL sample at cryogenic temperatures. Study suggests that the broad peak is emitted by the sidewall MQWs. This result indicates that the electroluminescence of sidewall MQWs, in which the carrier density is high enough, can be detected at cryogenic temperatures. The lineshape variation with current density reveals detailed information on the process of carrier injection into the sidewall MQWs.},

The combined effects of spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization are found to account well for carrier concentrations observed in AlGaN/GaN transistor structures with low to moderate Al concentrations, while the data for higher Al concentrations are consistent with defect formation in the AlGaN barrier. Theoretical analysis suggests that incorporation of In into the barrier and/or channel layers can substantially increase polarization charge at the heterojunction interface. The use of polarization effects to engineer Schottky barrier structures with large enhancements in barrier height is also discussed, and electrical characteristics of transistors with conventional and polarization-enhanced Schottky barrier gates are presented. The polarization-enhanced barrier is found to yield a marked reduction in gate leakage current, but to have little effect on transistor breakdown voltage.},

  abstract =        {This paper reviews the recent progress in the design and fabrication strategies of III-nitride semiconductor microdisk lasers on sapphire or Si substrates. Involving more accurate lithog. methods in the fabrication boosts quality factors (Q-factors) due to the improved optical confinement of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) at the rim of the microdisks with smooth sidewalls and perfect circularity. Quantum dots (QDs) as gain medium within the microdisks are investigated and promising for the demonstration of micro-lasers with super-high Q-factors and ultra-low thresholds. And these QD-cavity systems are also facilitating the research of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the strong coupling regime and cavity-enhanced single photon emission (SPE) for quantum computing. In this paper, we also report successful fabrication of transferred GaN free-standing microdisks with InGaN quantum wells (QWs) on conductive substrates, which achieves a significant step forward to realize elec. pumped high-quality microdisk lasers on target substrates. Strategies of applying flexible transparent electrodes such as graphene and metallic nanowires are potential effective solns. for realizing current-injection of nitride-based microdisks.

Unique to this material system is that its energy bandgap can be tuned from the deep ultraviolet ({\~{}}6.2 eV for AlN) to the near infrared ({\~{}}0.65 eV for InN). In this article, we provide an overview on the recent progress made in III-nitride nanowire optoelectronic devices, including light emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors, single photon sources, intraband devices, solar cells, and artificial photosynthesis. The present challenges and future prospects of III-nitride nanowire optoelectronic devices are also discussed.},
