Atomic force microscopy revealed that their dimensions were small enough to expect zero-dimensional quantum effects: the islands were typically 27 nm wide and 2.9 nm high. Strong blue-violet photoluminescence of the dots is observed, persisting up to room temperature. The temperature dependence of the photoluminescence is analyzed and compared to that of InGaN quantum well and bulk samples.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of patterned dry etching and selective-area regrowth by MOVPE enables us to fabricate the group III-nitride-based lasers of various shapes and sizes and to integrate these lasers on substrates. The vertical cavity mirrors are formed by selective-area regrowth of the dry-etched inclined facets. No growth occurs on the substrate surface exposed by dry etching. In this method, current-confining structures are self-organizing because of the change in Mg incorporation during the vertical facet formation. The selectively regrown Mg-doped GaN consisted of three regions by the regrowth of top, inclined, and vertical facet surfaces, respectively. These regions exhibited different contrast in scanning electron microscope observation and different cathodeluminescence spectra due to the difference in probability of Mg incorporation into them. This phenomenon was successfully applied to form current-confining structures of the lasers. These lasers lased at room temperature by pulsed current injection. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

We show that the c-type screw dislocations are not recombination active. The recombination strength of the a- and (a+c)-type dislocations is influenced by impurity gettering. While fresh dislocations exhibit a CL contrast of 0.01-0.05 in accordance with intrinsic dislocation states, grown in dislocations show a contrast of 0.25. From the analysis of spectral CL maps, we find that impurities such as oxygen and silicon are depleted in the surrounding of the dislocations. We explain the increased contrast by a reduced screening of the electrical field of the dislocation. (C) 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

Microphotoluminescence spectroscopy confirms the spectrally inhomogeneous distribution of localization centers, in which the exciton and the biexciton related emissions from single centers of varying geometry could be identified by means of excitation power dependencies. Interestingly, the biexciton binding energy (E(b)xx) was found to vary from center to center, between 3 to -22 meV, in correlation with the exciton emission energy. Negative binding energies are only justified by a three-dimensional quantum confinement, which confirms QD-like properties of the localization centers. The observed energy correlation is proposed to be understood as variations of the lateral extension of the confinement potential, which would yield smaller values of E(b)xx for reduced lateral extension and higher exciton emission energy. The proposed relation between lateral extension and E(b)xx is further supported by the exciton and the biexciton recombination lifetimes of a single QD, which suggest a lateral extension of merely ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼3 nm for a QD with strongly negative E(b)xx = -15.5 meV.},

Significant achievements have been made in developing III-nitride NW lasers with emission wavelengths from the deep ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared spectral range.

The temperature dependence of the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) was studied between 10 and 90 K. It linearly increased with increasing temperature from 40 to 80 K (similar to 7 mu eV/K), suggesting the existence of an excitonic dephasing mechanism. Pure dephasing of excitons due to exciton-phonon interactions in acoustic phonon mode was suggested as a possible mechanism for the PL line broadening.},

However, since the metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) of the group-III nitrides happens in a hydrogen-containing atmosphere, the surface decomposes during the SiN deposition. This work addresses the impact of the SiN growth with respect to temperature and surface dose. In particular, a quantitative analysis of the surface coverage is presented and the successive overgrowth with GaN is discussed in view of threading dislocation density and island growth mode.

  Abstract                 = {Direct epitaxial growth of inorganic compound semiconductors on lattice-matched single-crystal substrates has provided an important way to fabricate light sources for various applications including lighting, displays and optical communications. Nevertheless, unconventional substrates such as silicon, amorphous glass, plastics, and metals must be used for emerging optoelectronic applications, such as high-speed photonic circuitry and flexible displays. However, high-quality film growth requires good matching of lattice constants and thermal expansion coefficients between the film and the supporting substrate. This restricts monolithic fabrication of optoelectronic devices on unconventional substrates. Here, we describe methods to grow high-quality gallium nitride (GaN) microdisks on amorphous silicon oxide layers formed on silicon using micropatterned graphene films as a nucleation layer. Highly crystalline GaN microdisks having hexagonal facets were grown on graphene dots with intermediate ZnO nanowalls via epitaxial lateral overgrowth. Furthermore, whispering-gallery-mode lasing from the GaN microdisk with a Q-factor of 1200 was observed at room temperature.},

  Abstract                 = { Group III-nitride nanowires have attracted a lot of research interest in the past decade. They contain both the intrinsic properties of III-nitride materials and some unique properties induced by the nanowire structures. This article reviews the growth methods to obtain III-nitride nanowires, and discusses the pros and cons of both top-down and bottom-up approaches, with detailed discussions on different epitaxy methods. The most widely used catalyst-induced epitaxy and extrinsic particle free epitaxy to grow III-nitride nanowires are compared. The properties of those nanowires make them promising candidates for a broad range of applications, including optoelectronic, electronic and electromechanical devices, which are also presented, with a focus on the current challenges and recent progresses.This review was submitted as part of the 2016 Materials Literature Review Prize of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining run by the Editorial Board of MST.

  Abstract                 = {We report on a two-step process for the epitaxial lateral overgrowth of GaN. In the first step, the selective area epitaxy proceeds at low temperature and GaN stripes with a triangular cross section are rapidly obtained. Then, in a second step, these stripes are used as seeds for epitaxial lateral overgrowth, the growth conditions being changed either by increasing the growth temperature or by introducing a Mg precursor. Fully coalesced and planar GaN samples are: thereby achieved. A comparison between samples grown without and with this two-step process evidences an additional reduction in the threading defects density with the two-step process. The dislocations emerging from the seeds are drastically reduced to 5 x 10(6) to 10(7) cm(-2) between the coalescence boundaries.},

  Abstract                 = {Gallium nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor used to make light emitting diodes, a technology that could decrease global energy demands significantly if used worldwide. Yet there are barriers to making high efficiency GaN based devices: defects, including threading dislocations (TDs), hamper the quality of the GaN crystalline film. The hypotheses proposed to explain the origin of TDs are critically reviewed. It has been suggested that TDs form upon GaN island coalescence during initial stages of crystalline film growth, yet some transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy studies have shown few TDs at coalescence boundaries. Although harmful, TDs have a lesser effect on nitride based devices than on other compound semiconductors. Thus, GaN based devices are able to produce light despite high dislocation densities. This phenomenon has led to debate over the role of TDs in charge carrier recombination, which is reviewed. Some suggest that charge carriers arrive at TDs and recombine in a non-radiative manner, whereas others claim that they are repelled from the dislocations because the dislocation cores are electrically charged. The reduction of TDs in GaN films furthers the drive towards high efficiency devices. The final sections of this review address ways to effect reductions in TD density. Methods include changing growth conditions (including temperature and pressure), dosing the substrate with silane, and the exploitation of interlayers deposited during growth.},

  Abstract                 = { High-Q semiconductor microdisk resonators laterally coupled to optical waveguides serve as compact and robust components in wavelength-division-multiplexing systems. We present an efficient algorithm for the two-dimensional design of wavelength-selective filters based on waveguide-coupled whispering-gallery-mode (WGM) microresonators of arbitrary cross-sectional shape. A full-wave integral equation formulation enables us to accurately account for the coupling between the resonator and bus waveguide as well as for radiation and material losses. Furthermore, we apply this approach to the analysis of elliptic-resonator filters. Filter tuning by changing the resonator shape from circular to elliptic reduces the dependence of the coupling efficiency on the width of the air gap. Two alternative coupling designs are suggested for monolithic and hybrid integration technologies.

Quality factors as high as Q = 5x10(6) are measured in these microresonators, corresponding to a propagation loss coefficient as small as alpha {\~{}} 0.1 dB/cm. The different optical loss mechanisms are identified through a study of the total optical loss, mode coupling, and thermally-induced optical bistability as a function of microdisk radius (5-30 microm). These measurements indicate that optical loss in these high-Q microresonators is limited not by surface roughness, but rather by surface state absorption and bulk free-carrier absorption.},

A simulation was used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the artefact reduction.

It is well known that chemical etching solutions such as KOH, H 2SO4 and H3PO4, to selectively etch the N-face GaN but not the Ga-face GaN. In this study, the N-face GaN was exposed around the chip by laser scribing at the GaN/sapphire interface. These channels provided paths for the chemical etchant to flow and allow the etching solution to further contact with and etch the exposed bottom N-face GaN. Chemical etching of the chip sidewalls formed the inverted hexagonal pyramid shape with {\{}10 -1 -1{\}} facets. Findings show that inverted pyramid sidewalls enhance 20 mA LED output power by 27{\%} for LEDs, with chemical etching of the chip sidewalls for 4 min, compared to the conventional LED. The larger LED output power is attributed to increased light extraction efficiency by inverted pyramid sidewalls. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {Semiconductor nanowires refer to crystal structures with diameters as small as a few nanometers and lengths up to tens of micrometers or even millimeters. Nanowires can be produced either through conventional subtractive nanofabrication processes{,} via lithography and etching{,} or through additive nanomaterial growth methods. The quality of {"}top-down{"} fabricated nanowires are in principle determined by the starting material{,} although the size reduction techniques used to fabricate these structures inevitably introduce damage (e.g.{,} roughness) that can degrade overall quality. The top-down approach{,} which relies heavily on the precision of the lithography and etching tools{,} also becomes less cost-effective when scaling to ca. 10 nm size regimes. In this chapter we focus on nanowires produced through {"}bottom-up{"} growth methods{,} in which the critical dimension (e.g. the nanowire diameter) is limited not by lithography precision but controlled during chemical synthesis with atomic resolution. In particular{,} the catalyst-mediated vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) process is discussed in detail since this approach enables the growth of a broad range of nanowire materials with controlled structure{,} morphology{,} composition{,} and doping.},

  Abstract                 = {Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence (CL) have been used to determine the influence of edge and screw dislocations on the light emitting properties of InxGa1-xN quantum wells. TEM is used to locate and identify the nature of dislocations. CL on the same samples is used to determine the spatial variation of the luminescence. A direct correlation of CL maps with TEM has been established, showing that threading edge dislocations act as nonradiative recombination centers with an associated minority carrier diffusion length of 200 nm. Threading dislocations of screw and mixed type were found to be associated with surface pits which were also nonradiative in the quantum well (QW) emission, but owing to the absence of QW growth on the pit facets. The contributions of edge and screw/mixed dislocations to the reduction of the QW emission are quantified, and the wider significance of these results is discussed.

Under identical growth conditions of temperature and V/III ratio, both types of GaN nanowires are of wurtzite structure elongated in the Ga-polar direction and are constricted by M-plane facets. However, the catalyst-induced nanowires contain many more basal-plane stacking faults and their photoluminescence is weaker. These differences can be explained as effects of the catalyst Ni seeds. },

  Abstract                 = {Group-III-nitride semiconductors have shown enormous potential as light sources for full-colour displays, optical storage and solid-state lighting. Remarkably, InGaN blue- and green-light-emitting diodes (LEDs) emit brilliant light although the threading dislocation density generated due to lattice mismatch is six orders of magnitude higher than that in conventional LEDs. Here we explain why In-containing (Al,In,Ga)N bulk films exhibit a defect-insensitive emission probability. From the extremely short positron diffusion lengths ({\textless}4 nm) and short radiative lifetimes of excitonic emissions, we conclude that localizing valence states associated with atomic condensates of In-N preferentially capture holes, which have a positive charge similar to positrons. The holes form localized excitons to emit the light, although some of the excitons recombine at non-radiative centres. The enterprising use of atomically inhomogeneous crystals is proposed for future innovation in light emitters even when using defective crystals.},

From cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy, we found that all V defects are not always connected with TDs at their bottom. By increasing the indium composition in the InxGa1-xN well layer or decreasing the TD density of the thick GaN layer, many V defects are generated from the stacking mismatch boundaries induced by stacking faults which are formed within the MQW due to the strain relaxation. Also, TD density in the thick GaN layer affects not only the origin of V-defect formation but also the critical indium composition of the InxGa1-xN well on the formation of V defects.},

We observed anomalous emission behavior, specifically an /b S-shaped/ (decrease-increase-decrease) temperature dependence of the peak energy (E/sub p/) for InGaN-related PL with increasing temperature: E/sub p/ redshifts in the temperature range of 10-70 K, blueshifts for 70-150 K, and redshifts again for 150-300 K with increasing temperature. In addition, when E/sub p/ redshifts, the spectral width is observed to narrow, while when E/sub p/ blueshifts, it broadens. From a study of the integrated PL intensity as a function of temperature, it is found that thermionic emission of photocarriers out of local potential minima into higher energy states within the wells is the dominant mechanism leading to the thermal quenching of the InGaN-related PL. We demonstrate that the temperature-induced S-shaped PL shift is caused by a change in the carrier dynamics with increasing temperature due to inhomogeneity and carrier localization in the InGaN/GaN MQWs},

The fabrication relies on polymer encapsulation, nanowire lift-off and contacting using silver nanowire transparent electrodes. The LEDs exhibit rectifying behavior with a light-up voltage around 3 V. The devices show no electroluminescence degradation neither under multiple bending down to 3 mm curvature radius nor in time for more than one month storage in ambient conditions without any protecting encapsulation. Fully transparent flexible LEDs with high optical transmittance are also fabricated. Finally, a two-color flexible LED emitting in the green and blue spectral ranges is demonstrated combining two layers of InGaN/GaN nanowires with different In contents.},

PL linewidths as low as 40-70 meV at 10 K and 90-110 meV at 300 K indicate low dot size dispersion. The comparison of PL intensity versus temperature of an InGaN epilayer and InGaN/GaN QDs demonstrates the higher radiative efficiency of the latter. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics.

  Abstract                 = {Photon-based quantum information processing is based on manipulating multi photon interference. We focus on the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip in the photon coincidence rate which provides a direct measure of interference of indistinguishable photons linked to their Bose statistics. The effect has been first observed with entangled photons generated by parametric down conversion and then extended to independent emitters. Fluctuations caused by coupling between emitters and a bath can erode the interference which causes the dip. Here we show how the magnitude and shape of the HOM dip is affected by spectral diffusion induced by coupling to a brownian oscillator bath. Conditions for maintaining and controlling the interference are specified.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the growth by metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy of a InGaN/GaN resonant-cavity light emitting diode (RCLED) emitting at 454 nm and incorporating a 12-pair Al0.82In0.18N/GaN distributed Bragg reflector as bottom mirror. A(1-x)In(x)N layers with an Al content around x similar to 0.17 are lattice matched to GaN, thus avoiding strain-related issues in the subsequent active layers while keeping a high refractive index contrast of 7{\%}, comparable to that achievable in the Al0.5Ga0.5N/GaN system. Devices exhibit clear resonant-cavity effects, improved directionality in the radiation pattern and achieve an optical output of 1.7 mW and 2.6{\%} external quantum efficiency at 20 mA.

  Abstract                 = {Multiple-component decays of photoluminescence (PL) in InGaN/GaN quantum wells have been widely reported. However, their physical interpretations have not been well discussed yet. Based on wavelength-dependent and temperature-varying time-resolved PL measurements, the mechanism of carrier transport among different levels of localized states (spatially distributed) in such an indium aggregated structure was proposed for interpreting the early-stage fast decay, delayed slow rise, and extended slow decay of PL intensity. Three samples of the same quantum well geometry but different nominal indium contents, and hence different degrees of indium aggregation and carrier localization, were compared. The process of carrier transport was enhanced with a certain amount of thermal energy for overcoming potential barriers between spatially distributed potential minimums. In samples of higher indium contents, more complicated carrier localization potential structures led to enhanced carrier transport activities. Free exciton behaviors of the three samples at high temperatures are consistent with previously reported transmission electron microscopy results},

Here, we proposed a novel type of polariton system resulting from strong coupling between a two-dimensional exciton and whispering gallery mode photon using a core-shell GaN/InGaN hexagonal wire. High quality, nonpolar InGaN multiple-quantum wells (MQWs) were conformally formed on a GaN core nanowire, which was spatially well matched with whispering gallery modes inside the wire. Both high longitudinal-transverse splitting of nonpolar MQWs and high spatial overlap with whispering gallery modes lead to unprecedented large Rabi splitting energy of ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢Ãƒâ€¹Ã¢â‚¬Â Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¼180 meV. This structure provides a robust polariton effect with a small footprint; thus, it could be utilized for a wide range of interesting applications.},

This linewidth is significantly narrower than that of non-polar InGaN$\backslash$r$\backslash$nquantum dots$\backslash$r$\backslash$ngrown by alternate methods and may be indicative of reduced spectral diffusion. Time resolved photoluminescence studies reveal a mono-exponential exciton decay with a lifetime of 533 ps at 2.70 eV. The excitonic lifetime is more than an order of magnitude shorter than that for previously studied polar quantum dots and suggests the suppression of the internal electric field.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nCathodoluminescence studies show the spatial distribution of the quantum dots and resolution limited spectral peaks at 18 K.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the high density of threading dislocations generally found in (AlGaIn)N heterostructures, the light emission efficiency of such structures is exceptionally high. It has become common to attribute the high efficiency to compositional fluctuations or even phase separation in the active GaInN quantum well region. The resulting localization of charge carriers is thought to keep them from recombining nonradiatively at the defects. Here, we show that random disorder is not the key but that under suitable growth conditions hexagonal V-shaped pits decorating the defects exhibit narrow sidewall quantum wells with an effective band gap significantly larger than that of the regular c-plane quantum wells. Thereby nature provides a unique, hitherto unrecognized mechanism generating a potential landscape which effectively screens the defects themselves by providing an energy barrier around every defect.},

  Abstract                 = {The monolithic integration of wurtzite GaN on Si via metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy is strongly hampered by lattice and thermal mismatch as well as meltback etching. This study presents single-layer graphene as an atomically thin buffer layer for c-axis-oriented growth of vertical GaN nanorods initiated through nanometer-sized AlGaN nucleation islands. Nanostructures of similar morphology are demonstrated on graphene-covered Si(111) as well as Si(100). High crystal and optical quality of the nanorods are evidenced through scanning transmission electron microscopy, micro-Raman and cathodoluminescence measurements supported by finite-difference time-domain simulations. Current-voltage characteristics revealed high vertical conduction of the as-grown GaN nanorods through the Si substrates. These findings are substantial to advance the integration of GaN-based devices on any substrates of choice that sustain the GaN growth temperatures, thereby permitting novel designs of GaN-based heterojunction device concepts.},

InGaN QDs are successfully fabricated by the growth mode transition to three-dimensional nanoscale island formation by using "antisurfactant" silicon on AlGaN surface. The diameter and height of the fabricated InGaN QDs an estimated to be similar to 10 nm and similar to 5 nm, respectively, by an atomic-force microscope (AFM). Indium mole fraction of InxGa1-xN QDs is controlled from x = similar to 0.22 to similar to 0.52 by varying the growth temperature of QDs. Intense photoluminescence is observed even at room temperature from InGaN QDs embedded with the GaN capping layers. In addition, from the temperature dependence of the PL-peak energy, we convincingly show that the PL emission actually comes from the InGaN QDs. (C) 1998 American Institute of Physics.

  Abstract                 = {Three-dimensional (3D) data represent the basis for reliable quantification of complex microstructures. Therefore, the development of high-resolution tomography techniques is of major importance for many materials science disciplines. In this paper, we present a novel serial sectioning procedure for 3D analysis using a dual-beam FIB (focused ion beam). A very narrow and reproducible spacing between the individual imaging planes is achieved by using drift correction algorithms in the automated slicing procedure. The spacing between the planes is nearly of the same magnitude as the pixel resolution on scanning electron microscopy images. Consequently, the acquired stack of images can be transformed directly into a 3D data volume with a voxel resolution of 6 x 7 x 17 nm. To demonstrate the capabilities of FIB nanotomography, a BaTiO3 ceramic with a high volume fraction of fine porosity was investigated using the method as a basis for computational microstructure analysis and the results compared with conventional physical measurements. Significant differences between the particle size distributions as measured by nanotomography and laser granulometry indicate that the latter analysis is skewed by particle agglomeration/aggregation in the raw powder and by uncertainties related to calculation assumptions. Significant differences are also observed between the results from mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and 3D pore space analysis. There is strong evidence that the ink-bottle effect leads to an overestimation of the frequency of small pores in MIP. FIB nanotomography thus reveals quantitative information of structural features smaller than 100 nm in size which cannot be acquired easily by other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Fabrication of single InGaN quantum dots (QDs) on top of GaN micropyramids is reported. The formation of single QDs is evidenced by showing single sub-millielectronvolt emission lines in microphotoluminescence ($\mu$PL) spectra. Tunable QD emission energy by varying the growth temperature of the InGaN layers is also demonstrated. From $\mu$PL, it is evident that the QDs are located in the apexes of the pyramids. The fact that the emission lines of the QDs are linear polarized in a preferred direction implies that the apexes induce unidirected anisotropic fields to the QDs. The single emission lines remain unchanged with increasing the excitation power and/or crystal temperature. An in-plane elongated QD forming a shallow potential with an equal number of trapped electrons and holes is proposed to explain the absence of other exciton complexes.},

A solid-state quantum computer based on localized electron spins as qubits is therefore of potential interest. Here, a scheme that realizes controlled interactions between two distant quantum dot spins is proposed. The effective long-range interaction is mediated by the vacuum field of a high finesse microcavity. By using conduction-band- hole Raman transitions induced by classical laser fields and the cavity-mode, parallel controlled-not operations, and arbitrary single qubit rotations can be realized.},

First we discuss the relation between the conditions for the onset of equilibrium and nonequilibrium excitonic condensates. Provided that the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\lambda$T exceeds the exciton Bohr radius aB, an exciton laser operates without electronic population inversion. In contrast to previous proposals, this is a different type of laser without inversion which utilizes many-body coherences. When the excitonic character of the polariton branch vanishes, a polariton laser becomes indistinguishable from a photon laser. {\textcopyright} 1996 The American Physical Society.},

The FIB sample preparation has the advantage of high positioning accuracy for cross sections. On the other hand, a broad ion beam (BIB) has been conventionally used for thinning TEM samples. Although both FIB and BIB use energetic ion beams, they are essentially different from each other in many aspects such as beam size, beam current density, incident angle of the beam with respect to cross sections, and beam scanning (i.e., dynamic or static beam). In this study, FIB cross-sectioning is compared with BIB thinning. We review inherent characteristics such as positioning accuracy and uniformity of cross section, radiation damage, and beam heating. Discussion is held from a view-point of ion beam and sample interaction.},

However, because of the lack of systematic design principles to precisely control bending and guiding in three dimensions, as well as advancements in the fabrication technology necessary for the realization of large- area, defect-free three-dimensional photonic crystals, the arbi- trary three-dimensional manipulation of photons has yet to be demonstrated. Here, we develop a new design concept for three-dimensional waveguides and bends, and realize it exper- imentally in silicon three-dimensional photonic crystals. We demonstrate clear three-dimensional optical guiding phenom- ena, in which light is incident on the crystal from one side, is bent vertically and horizontally (and is even split into two or trapped by an intermediate nanocavity), and is finally emitted from the other side of the crystal. These results will open the door to the realization of three-dimensional optical chips with various functionalities.},

  Abstract                 = {The electron microprobe produces two-dimensional images of elemental distributions by displaying X-ray photon-caused pulses on a cathode ray tube as the electron beam scans the sample. The usefulness of the microprobe in mineralogy, diminished by this inaccurate qualitative elemental recording method, increases significantly with quantification of two-dimensionally collected X-ray intensities. A simple intemrpt circuit added to the micro-probe's electron beam scanner defines the raster rate for a data collection computer. The computer, monitoring the X-ray spectrometers through counters, collects X-ray intensities at peak and background spectrometer positions from a rectangular grid of2,0fi) points from single or multiple rasters. Standards, scanned in the same manner as analytes, give a grid of X-ray intensities defining a least-squares fitted surface to compensate for areal defocusing of the spectrometers, and to quantify sample composition. Smoothing eliminates spurious intensities caused by counting statistics and sample surface irregularities. Measurement of up to eight elements per sample permits first-principles matrix corrections with mass-absorption coefficients, etc. The computer groups the 2000 data points into compositional families to make matrix correction calculations practical. The computer plots contour maps of elemental distributions or ratios with or without matrix correction and quantification. Compositional mapping enhances the probe's areal sensitivity and utility. Introduction The electron microprobe determines in-situ ele-mental composition and distribution for minerals on a microscopic scale, presenting quantitative X-ray information about elemental concentrations on the surface of polished specimens. An electron beam scans the surface of the sample, three different ways: spot, line, or rectangular area. The spot and line modes produce quantifiable elemental concen-trations but recording techniques usually limit the presentation of areal elemental distribution to dots on a photograph. The inadequacy of the standard microprobe as a quantitative areal elemental analyser is illustrated through an example. Figure I shows a typical elemental distribution X-ray dot picture. Each dot represents a detected X-ray photon characteristic of calcium. The relative density of the dots shows the m03-004)V82l0506-452 l {\$}02.00},

There has been an active debate on the mechanisms that give rise to efficient luminescence in these materials. In this paper we approach these questions through optical studies of single InGaN/GaN quantum dots in the context of the available experimental and theoretical understanding of InGaN structures in general, and of three-dimensional localization in this material in particular. We will also show how it is possible to exploit the various unique properties that nitride-based materials offer, such as the strong inbuilt electric field, in a controlled manner. Such control may in the future prove essential for the implementation of single quantum dot devices in applications such as quantum information processing. We also show how nonlinear spectroscopy provides an invaluable tool in suppressing background luminescence effects inherent in this material.},

Through the reduction of the number of quantum dots using submicron mesa structures, we have obtained several isolated photoluminescence peaks emitted by individual quantum dots. With increasing excitation power, an additional peak emerges in the higher-energy side of an excitonic ground state. This additional peak shows quadratic power dependence, and is attributed to the photoluminescence from a biexciton state. The biexciton binding energy is negative and the magnitude is about 30 meV, which is explained by the effects of a strong built-in electric field. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics},

  Abstract                 = {Fundamentally secure quantum cryptography has still not seen widespread application owing to the difficulty of generating single photons on demand. Semiconductor quantum-dot structures have recently shown great promise as practical single-photon sources, and devices with integrated optical cavities and electrical-carrier injection have already been demonstrated. However, a significant obstacle for the application of commonly used III-V quantum dots to quantum-information-processing schemes is the requirement of liquid-helium cryogenic temperatures. Epitaxially grown gallium nitride quantum dots embedded in aluminium nitride have the potential for operation at much higher temperatures. Here, we report triggered single-photon emission from gallium nitride quantum dots at temperatures up to 200 K, a temperature easily reachable with thermo-electric cooling. Gallium nitride quantum dots also open a new wavelength region in the blue and near-ultraviolet portions of the spectrum for single-photon sources.},

In order to achieve such an ideal experimental condition for the TEMT, improvements in the specimen as well as the sample holder were made. A rod-shaped specimen was necessary in order to obtain a high transmission of the specimen upon tilting to large angles. The image resolution of the reconstructed tomogram was isotropic, in sharp contrast to the anisotropic image resolution of the conventional TEMT with a limited angular range (the "missing wedge" problem). A volume fraction of zirconia, $\phi$, evaluated from the 3D reconstruction was in quantitative agreement with the known composition of the nanocomposite. A series of 3D reconstructions was made from the tilt series with complete rotation by limiting the maximum tilt angle, $\alpha$, from which a couple of structural parameters, the volume fraction and surface area per unit volume, $\Sigma$, of the zirconia, were evaluated as a function of $\alpha$. It was confirmed from actual experimental data that both $\phi$ and $\Sigma$ slightly decreased with the increasing $\alpha$ and reached constant values at around $\alpha$ = 80 ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â°, suggesting that the specimen may have to be tilted to ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â±80ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â° for truly quantitative measurements. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This approach, based on inÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â situ deposition of a thin SiN x layer (~2ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â nm), enables epitaxial growth of c -oriented wires with 200ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ1500ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â nm diameters and a large length/diameter ratio (>100) on c -plane sapphire substrate. Detailed study of the growth mechanisms shows that a combination of key parameters is necessary to obtain vertical growth. In particular, the duration of the SiN x deposition prior to the wire growth is critical for controlling the epitaxy with the substrate. The GaN seed nucleation time determines the mean size diameter and structural quality, and a high Si-dopant concentration promotes vertical growth. Such GaN wires exhibit UV-light emission centred at ~350ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â nm and a weak yellow band (~550ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â nm) at low temperature.},

Nonresonant pulsed excitation results in a broad PL peak, while resonant excitation into the nonresonant PL intensity maximum results in an evolution of a sharp resonant PL peak, having a spectral shape defined by the excitation laser pulse and a radiative decay time close to that revealed for PL under nonresonant excitation. Observation of a resonantly excited narrow PL line gives clear proof of the quantum dot nature of luminescence in InGaN-GaN samples. PL decay demonstrates strongly nonexponential behavior evidencing coexistence of quantum dots having similar ground-state transition energy, but very different electron-hole wave-function overlap.},

For low miscut angle, a crack-free morphology consisting of randomly sized domains is observed, between which there are notable shifts in the AlGaN near band edge emission energy. For high miscut angle, a morphology with step bunches and compositional inhomogeneities along the step bunches, evidenced by an additional CL peak along the step bunches, are observed.

InGaN quantum dots and InGaN quantum wires have been fabricated.

This technique proved to be efficient in realizing practically damage-free etching, hence preventing the deterioration of the nanostructure's crystal quality. The density, size, and positions of the nanostructures could be well designed and controlled using the above process.

  Abstract                 = {Basal-plane stacking faults are an important class of optically active structural defects in wurtzite semiconductors. The local deviation from the 2H stacking of the wurtzite matrix to a 3C zinc-blende stacking induces a bound state in the gap of the host crystal, resulting in the localization of excitons. Due to the two-dimensional nature of these planar defects, stacking faults act as quantum wells, giving rise to radiative transitions of excitons with characteristic energies. Luminescence spectroscopy is thus capable of detecting even a single stacking fault in an otherwise perfect wurtzite crystal. This review draws a comprehensive picture of the luminescence properties related to stacking faults in GaN. The emission energies associated with different types of stacking faults as well as factors that can shift these energies are discussed. In this context, the importance of the quantum-confined Stark effect in these zinc-blende/wurtzite heterostructures, which results from the spontaneous polarization of wurtzite GaN, is underlined. This discussion is extended to zinc-blende segments in a wurtzite matrix. Furthermore, other factors affecting the emission energy and linewidth of stacking fault-related peaks as well as results obtained at room temperature are addressed. The considerations presented in this article should be transferable also to other wurtzite semiconductors.},

We propose two approaches fully compatible with planar fabrication, which allow to increase the cavity Q's by several orders of magnitude while keeping constant the mode volume V of the cavity. The first approach consists of engineering the mirror to taper the guided mode into the mirror Bloch mode, thus decreasing losses. The second approach is less intuitive and relies on a recycling mechanism of the radiation losses. The study is supported by computational results obtained for two-dimensional silicon-on-insulator geometries, but the results apply as well to other related geometries like three-dimensional photonic-wire cavities.},

  Abstract                 = {Deposition of pure and Ge-doped silica as well as silicon oxynitride films has been studied in a recently developed matrix distributed electron cyclotron resonance (MDECR) reactor. Process parameters were optimized in order to obtain optical quality thin films at low substrate temperatures and high de- position rates without post-deposition treatment. The choice of injection system is shown to be of crucial importance for the deposition of high quality materials in low pressure PECVD. It has been found that injecting silane near the surface allows to obtain films with a low OH absorption independently of silane flow i.e. growth rate in a certain range of process parameters. On the contrary, in the case of uniform distribution of silane in the reactor volume the hydrogen content increases with silane flow, which affects the quality of films deposited at higher rates. With the optimized injection system, stress-free silica films with a low absorption have been deposited at the rates up to 70 nm/min at temperatures lower than 150 ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦C.

Ge-doped silica films with a Ge content of up to 4{\%} has been deposited using a mixture GeH4 in H2 as a dopant. The properties of deposited films have been studied as a function of process parameters. The results show that the MDECR concept, that permits, in principle, unlimited scaling of substrate size, can be technology of choice for the deposition of optical thin films and functional coatings.},

It is found that the density and averaged size of V-defects increases with QB thickness, resulting in larger reverse- and forward-bias current in LEDs. Electroluminescence measurement shows that LED with thinner QB has higher internal quantum efficiency but lower efficiency droop-onset current density, which should be ascribed to the faster saturation of carrier leakage into V-defects. Correspondingly, above the droop-onset current density, severer Auger recombination and carrier overflow are induced by higher carrier density due to the less V-defect related carrier leakage, leading to the more serious droop phenomenon in LEDs with thinner QB.},

  Abstract                 = {Nowadays, tomography plays a central role in pureand applied science, in medicine, and in many branches of engineering and technology. It entails reconstructing the three-dimensional (3D) structure of an object from a tilt series of two-dimensional (2D) images.

In this Account, we review the advances that have been made in facilitating the recording of the required series of 2D electron microscopic images and the subsequent process of 3D reconstruction of specimens that are vulnerable, to a greater or lesser degree, to electron beam damage. We describe how high-fidelity 3D tomograms may be obtained from relatively few 2D images by incorporating prior structural knowledge into the reconstruction process. In particular, we highlight the vital role of compressed sensing, a recently developed procedure well-known to information theorists that exploits ideas of image compression and "sparsity" (that the important image information can be captured in a reduced data set). We also touch upon another promising approach, "discrete" tomography, which builds into the reconstruction process a prior assumption that the object can be described in discrete terms, such as the number of constituent materials and their expected densities. Other advances made recently that we outline, such as the availability of aberration-corrected electron microscopes, electron wavelength monochromators, and sophisticated specimen goniometers, have all contributed significantly to the further development of quantitative 3D studies of nanostructured materials, including nanoparticle-heterogeneous catalysts, fuel-cell components, and drug-delivery systems, as well as photovoltaic and plasmonic devices, and are likely to enhance our knowledge of many other facets of materials chemistry, such as organic-inorganic composites, solar-energy devices, bionanotechnology, biomineralization, and energy-storage systems composed of high-permittivity metal oxides.},

  Abstract                 = {The influence of polarity during the MOVPE growth of GaN based sub-micrometer (sub-$\mu$m) rods has mostly been neglected up to now. In this paper we demonstrate that the surface polarity plays a crucial role for the morphology of the GaN sub-$\mu$m rods. Based on the differences between N-polar and Ga-polar surfaces, a model is suggested to explain the influence of various parameters on the morphology of GaN sub-$\mu$mrods for the first time. For Ga-polar GaN, the {\{}10-11{\}} r-planes, similar to N-polar (000-1) c-planes, are terminated by nitrogen atoms. These N-terminated surfaces can be passivated by hydrogen,which leads to a stable surface with low growth rates and therefore tends to keep a pyramidal shape with stable r-planes. For N-polar GaN, {\{}10-1-1{\}} r-planes can be modified by H2 etching, leading to the formation of more stable {\{}1-100{\}} m-planes, hence supporting the formation of sub-$\mu$m rods with vertical sidewalls.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, GaN nanorods are emerging as a very promising novel route toward devices for nano-optoelectronics and nano-photonics. In particular, core-shell light emitting devices are thought to be a breakthrough development in solid state lighting, nanorod based LEDs have many potential advantages as compared to their 2 D thin film counterparts. In this paper, we review the recent developments of GaN nanorod growth, characterization, and related device applications based on GaN nanorods. The initial work on GaN nanorod growth focused on catalyst-assisted and catalyst-free statistical growth. The growth condition and growth mechanisms were extensively investigated and discussed. Doping of GaN nanorods, especially p-doping, was found to significantly influence the morphology of GaN nanorods. The large surface of 3 D GaN nanorods induces new optical and electrical properties, which normally can be neglected in layered structures. Recently, more controlled selective area growth of GaN nanorods was realized using patterned substrates both by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) and by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Advanced structures, for example, photonic crystals and DBRs are meanwhile integrated in GaN nanorod structures. Based on the work of growth and characterization of GaN nanorods, GaN nanoLEDs were reported by several groups with different growth and processing methods. Core/shell nanoLED structures were also demonstrated, which could be potentially useful for future high efficient LED structures. In this paper, we will discuss recent developments in GaN nanorod technology, focusing on the potential advantages, but also discussing problems and open questions, which may impose obstacles during the future development of a GaN nanorod based LED technology.},

In contrast to the currently accepted view that C substituting for N is a shallow acceptor, we find that has an ionization energy of 0.90 eV. Our calculated absorption and emission lines also indicate that is a likely source for the yellow luminescence that is frequently observed in GaN, solving the longstanding puzzle of the nature of the C-related defect involved in yellow emission. Our results suggest that previous experimental data, analyzed under the assumption that acts as a shallow acceptor, should be re-examined.},

However, in the last decade the family tree of methods has grown significantly. This is partly through advances in instrumentation. The introduction of the focused ion beam microscope and the transformation of transmission electron microscopy into a multipurpose analytical and structural tool have made major impacts. The main driving force for progress is perhaps the advent of nanotechnology with the need to achieve nanometer-scale resolution and the desire to get a real three-dimensional view of the nanoscale world. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Microdisks, approximately 9 mu m in diameter and regularly spaced every 50 mu m, were formed by an ion beam etch process, Individual disks were pumped at 300 and 10 K with 290 nm laser pulses focused to a spot size much smaller than the disk diameter, Optical modes corresponding to (i) the radial mode type with a spacing of 49-51 meV (both TE and TM) and (ii) the Whispering Gallery mode With a spacing of 15-16 meV were observed in the GaN microdisk cavities. The spacings of these modes are consistent with those expected for modes within a resonant cavity of cylindrical symmetry, refractive index, and dimensions of the microdisks under investigation, The GaN-based microdisk cavity is compared with its GaAs counterpart and implications regarding future GaN-based microdisk lasers are discussed.

For strained InxGa1-xN, it was determined that the band gap shift versus composition is given by dE(g)/dx=-4.1 eV for x{\textless}0.12. Our results contradict some recent reports that InxGa1-xN has a relatively small bowing parameter. Possible reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. (C) 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

The PL measurements show a large number of high Q factor resonant modes on the whole spectrum, which allows us to identify the different radial mode families and to compare them with simulations. We report a considerable improvement of the Q factor, which reflects the etching quality and the relatively low cavity loss by inserting QDs into the cavity. GaN/AlN QDs-based $\mu$-disks show very high Q values (Q{\textgreater}7000) whereas the Q factor is only up to 2000 in $\mu$-disks embedding QDs grown on the AlGaN barrier layer. We attribute this difference to the lower absorption below bandgap for AlN barrier layers at the energies of our experimental investigation.},

  Abstract                 = {The rapid advances in nanotechnology and the ever decreasing size of features in the microelectronics industry brings with it the need for advanced characterisation with high spatial resolution in two and three dimensions. Stereo microscopy allows some insight into the three-dimensional nature of an object but for true quantitative analysis, one has to turn to tomography as a way to reconstruct a three-dimensional object from a series of two-dimensional projections (images). X-ray tomography allow structures to be imaged at relatively large length scales, atom probe tomography at the atomic level. Electron tomography offers an intermediate resolution (of about 1nm) with a field of view of hundreds of nm making it ideal for the characterisation of many nanoscale devices. Whilst electron tomography has been used in the biological sciences for more than 30 years, it is only now being applied to the physical sciences. In this paper, we review the status of electron tomography, describe the basis behind the technique and some of the practicalities of recording and analysing data for tomographic reconstruction, particularly in regard to solving three-dimensional problems that are encountered in materials science at the nanometre level. We present examples of how STEM dark-field imaging and energy-filtered TEM can be used successfully to examine nearly all types of specimens likely to be encountered by the physical scientist. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A strained InGaN thin film which contains composition-fluctuated regions shows the so-called S-shaped temperature dependence of the dominant PL peak energy. However, an InGaN thick film which contains quantum dot-like In-rich regions shows a sigmoidal temperature dependence of the dominant PL peak energy, as the result of a transfer of carriers from the band-edge related luminescent centers to quantum dot-like In-rich regions. It is also found that the activation energy for the thermal quenching of PL intensity in the InGaN thick film which contains quantum dot-like In-rich regions is larger than that in the strained InGaN thin film which contains composition-fluctuated regions},

A thin aluminum layer with 400 nm square apertures was formed on the sample surface to reduce the number of QDs measured. We observed very sharp peaks whose spectral linewidths were typically 170 mu eV at 3.5 K, the linewidth being limited by spectral resolution. Such sharp lines were not observed in similar experiments on a reference sample having single InGaN quantum well structure. These experimental results suggest that excitons are strongly confined in our InGaN QD structure. (C) 2000 American Institute of Physics. [S0003-6951(00)02817-5].},

Band positions on an absolute energy scale are determined from surface calculations. The resulting GaN/InN valence-band offset is 0.62 eV. The dependence of InGaN valence-band alignment on In content is found to be almost linear. Based on the values of band gaps and band alignments, we conclude that InGaN fulfills the requirements for a photoelectrochemical electrode for In contents up to 50{\%}},

The results show that the increasing of the cavitylength, increases the maximal gain, and decreases the output power. Also, the decreasing of tempera-ture increases the maximal gain and output power.

Based on these results surface structures and growth conditions have been identified which allow to overcome intrinsic (thermodynamic) materials properties and limitations. Examples which will be discussed concern the enhancement of the doping efficiency, the formation of novel (tailor-made) alloys, and the self-organized growth of nano-structures},

  Abstract                 = {InxGa1-xN/GaN quantum dot (QD) arrays with high spatial densities have the potential to improve the performance of GaN-based optoelectronic devices. The growth of such QD arrays may be achieved in metal-organic vapour phase epitaxy by pre-dosing the GaN surface with a silicon-bearing precursor. Here, we investigate the mechanism of QD formation in this case, and suggest that for short SiH4 predoses, the variation of island density with predose duration, and the merging of the observed islands with increasing InxGa1-xN growth time, indicate that the SiH4 is roughening the GaN surface, increasing the number of available nucleation sites, and leading to a change in growth mode. For longer SiH4 predoses, a different mechanism appears to operate. However, we find no evidence for the presence of an SiNx nanomask, but instead note that the observed islands have a distinctive and consistent shape, indicating the influence of strain and surface energy contributions on the growth mode. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  Abstract                 = {First- and second-order piezoelectric coefficients for all binary group-III nitride (III-N)wurtzite semiconductors are calculated using ab initio density functional theory. The method used allows the simultaneous determination of spontaneous and strain-induced polarization within the same framework. Although the linear coefficients are similar to all existing values reported in the literature, all spontaneous polarization terms are substantially smaller than the currently proposed values. Second-order coefficients also change the total strain-induced polarization significantly. We compare the predictions obtained using these coefficients with data in superlattice structures comprising binary nitride semiconductors and by including composition dependence with all available experimental data on III-N ternary alloys. We show that, unlike existing models, our calculated piezoelectric coefficients and nonlinear model provide a close match to the internal piezoelectric fields of quantum well and superlattice structures.},

Employing one-dimensional photonic crystalcavities coupled to integrated optical circuits, we measure quality factors up to 146 000. By varying the waveguide-cavity coupling gap, extinction ratios in excess of 15 dB are obtained. Our results open the door for integrated photonic bandgap structures made from a low loss, wide-transparency, nonlinear optical material system.},

The peak quantum efficiency of such LED exceeds 100{\%}, but the maximum wall-plug efficiency (WPE) hardly changes. However, due to the increased bias, the WPE peaks at much higher input power, i.e., the WPE droop is significantly delayed, and the output power is strongly enhanced.

  Abstract                 = {It is shown that in n-GaN samples with a strong yellow luminescence band the deep levels spectra measured by optical transient current spectroscopy (OTCS) is always dominated by a hole trap at Ev+0.85eV which is absent in the spectra of the samples with weak yellow luminescence. Based on the results of recent theoretical calculations it is suggested that these traps could be gallium vacancies VGa and that the centers responsible for yellow luminescence are formed by pairing such vacancies with shallow donors. The results indicate that the yellow luminescence band could be the dominant recombination channel in the samples with strong yellow luminescence band whereas in the samples with weak yellow luminescence recombination this role is taken over by nonradiative recombination centers. Deep levels transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements revealed the existence of a barrier for capture of electrons for electron traps at EcÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢0.55eV (0.15eV) and EcÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Â ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¡ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢0.8eV (about 0.35eV) and a possible role of such traps in persistent photoconductivity at room temperature in n-GaN is discussed.},

The growth regime for GaN on AlxGa1-xN was observed to change from two- to three-dimensional, forming GaN QDs, when Si was deposited on the AlxGa1-xN surface prior to the GaN growth. These QDs showed a redshift of the photo luminescence (PL) energy from the increased Coulomb energy induced by a compression of the exciton Bohr radius. Furthermore, a diminishing temperature-dependent shift of the PL energy with decreasing QD size caused by a reduction of the longitudinal-optical phonon coupling was found. We also show that the size of the QDs is a critical parameter for the optical nonlinearities. For large dots, the dominant nonlinearity in the PL is the bandgap renormalization but when the size of the dots was reduced below the critical size of 10 nm thick and 30 nm diameter, the state-filling effect became dominant.

  Abstract                 = {Cavity quantum electrodynamics, a central research field in optics and solid-state physics, addresses properties of atom-like emitters in cavities and can be divided into a weak and a strong coupling regime. For weak coupling, the spontaneous emission can be enhanced or reduced compared with its vacuum level by tuning discrete cavity modes in and out of resonance with the emitter. However, the most striking change of emission properties occurs when the conditions for strong coupling are fulfilled. In this case there is a change from the usual irreversible spontaneous emission to a reversible exchange of energy between the emitter and the cavity mode. This coherent coupling may provide a basis for future applications in quantum information processing or schemes for coherent control. Until now, strong coupling of individual two-level systems has been observed only for atoms in large cavities. Here we report the observation of strong coupling of a single two-level solid-state system with a photon, as realized by a single quantum dot in a semiconductor microcavity. The strong coupling is manifest in photoluminescence data that display anti-crossings between the quantum dot exciton and cavity-mode dispersion relations, characterized by a vacuum Rabi splitting of about 140 microeV.},

  Abstract                 = {Gallium nitride (GaN) and its allied binaries InN and AIN as well as their ternary compounds have gained an unprecedented attention due to their wide-ranging applications encompassing green, blue, violet, and ultraviolet (UV) emitters and detectors (in photon ranges inaccessible by other semiconductors) and high-power amplifiers. However, even the best of the three binaries, GaN, contains many structural and point defects caused to a large extent by lattice and stacking mismatch with substrates. These defects notably affect the electrical and optical properties of the host material and can seriously degrade the performance and reliability of devices made based on these nitride semiconductors. Even though GaN broke the long-standing paradigm that high density of dislocations precludes acceptable device performance, point defects have taken the center stage as they exacerbate efforts to increase the efficiency of emitters, increase laser operation lifetime, and lead to anomalies in electronic devices. The point defects include native isolated defects (vacancies, interstitial, and antisites), intentional or unintentional impurities, as well as complexes involving different combinations of the isolated defects. Further improvements in device performance and longevity hinge on an in-depth understanding of point defects and their reduction. In this review a comprehensive and critical analysis of point defects in GaN, particularly their manifestation in luminescence, is presented. In addition to a comprehensive analysis of native point defects, the signatures of intentionally and unintentionally introduced impurities are addressed. The review discusses in detail the characteristics and the origin of the major luminescence bands including the ultraviolet, blue, green, yellow, and red bands in undoped GaN. The effects of important group-II impurities, such as Zn and Mg on the photoluminescence of GaN, are treated in detail. Similarly, but to a lesser extent, the effects of other impurities, such as C, Si, H, O, Be, Mn, Cd, etc., on the luminescence properties of GaN are also reviewed. Further, atypical luminescence lines which are tentatively attributed to the surface and structural defects are discussed. The effect of surfaces and surface preparation, particularly wet and dry etching, exposure to UV light in vacuum or controlled gas ambient, annealing, and ion implantation on the characteristics of the defect-related emissions is described.

  Abstract                 = {Sub-band-gap absorption of GaN grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition on sapphire was investigated by photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), transmission measurements, and the constant photocurrent method (CPM). We determine acceptor binding energies in undoped GaN at 220 and about 720 meV. A comparison between absorption and CPM spectra yields the dependence of the quantum efficiency-mobility-lifetime-product ($\eta$$\mu$$\tau$) versus energy and gives relevant information about the excitation mechanisms. CPM spectra show a significantly smaller absorption (up to a factor of 1/10) in the range between 3.0 and 3.3 eV as compared to PDS. This indicates that the majority of carriers excited with these photon energies have a relatively small $\eta$$\mu$$\tau$ product and thus do not contribute to the externally detected photocurrent. We propose that in this energy range the spectrum is dominated by interband absorption in isolated cubic-phase crystallites in the hexagonal matrix and by excitation of electrons from occupied acceptors into the conduction band of the main hexagonal crystal modification (h-GaN). Temperature-dependent photoluminescence measurements, excited with energies below and above the direct band gap of hexagonal GaN, confirm this interpretation and can be correlated with the subgap absorption detected by PDS. Transient photocurrent measurements show a persistent photoconductivity, which can also be explained by the existence of isolated cubic-phase inclusions.},

  Abstract                 = {Cavity polaritons, the elementary optical excitations of semiconductor microcavities, may be understood as a superposition of excitons and cavity photons. Owing to their composite nature, these bosonic particles have a distinct optical response, at the same time very fast and highly nonlinear. Very efficient light amplification due to polariton-polariton parametric scattering has recently been reported in semiconductor microcavities at liquid-helium temperatures. Here we demonstrate polariton parametric amplification up to 120 K in GaAlAs-based microcavities and up to 220 K in CdTe-based microcavities. We show that the cut-off temperature for the amplification is ultimately determined by the binding energy of the exciton. A 5-micrometer-thick planar microcavity can amplify a weak light pulse more than 5,000 times. The effective gain coefficient of an equivalent homogeneous medium would be 107 cm-1. The subpicosecond duration and high efficiency of the amplification could be exploited for high-repetition all-optical microscopic switches and amplifiers. 105 polaritons occupy the same quantum state during the amplification, realizing a dynamical condensate of strongly interacting bosons which can be studied at high temperature.},

Here, we show that multiple-active region phosphor-free InGaN nanowire white LEDs connected through a polarization engineered tunnel junction can fundamentally address the afore-described challenges. Such a p-GaN contact-free LED offers the benefit of carrier regeneration, leading to enhanced light intensity and reduced efficiency droop. Moreover, through the monolithic integration of p-GaN up and p-GaN down nanowire LED structures on the same substrate, we have demonstrated, for the first time, AC operated LEDs on a Si platform, which can operate efficiently in both polarities (positive and negative) of applied voltage.},

Gain, resulting in a deepening of the lower polariton reflectivity dip, is observed on the resonant beam. Simultaneously, the luminescence of large in-plane wave-vector states decreases linearly with the resonant power.},

  Abstract                 = {Lasing action has been demonstrated at blue wavelengths in vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers at room temperature. The microcavity was formed by sandwiching indium gallium nitride multiple quantum wells between nitride-based and oxide-based quarter-wave reflectors. Lasing action was observed at a wavelength of 399 nanometers under optical excitation and confirmed by a narrowing of the linewidth in the emission spectra from 0.8 nanometer below threshold to less than 0.1 nanometer (resolution limit) above threshold. The result suggests that practical blue vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers can be realized in gallium-nitride-based material systems.},

The hole diffusion length in n-type GaN was estimated to be neighboring 50 nm by comparing the diameters of the dark spots in thick samples used for CL and samples that were thinned for TEM observation. The efficiency of light emission is high as long as the minority carrier diffusion length is shorter than the dislocation spacing.},

  Abstract                 = {Polarity issues affecting III-V nitride semiconductors are reviewed with respect to their determination and control. A set of conditions crucial to the polarity control of GaN is provided for each of the following growth techniques; molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), pulsed laser deposition (PLD) and hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). Although GaN films might have been deposited by identical growth methods using the same buffer layer technologies, there is often a conflict between the resulting polarities achieved by different research groups. In this paper, we present the implications of the conditions used in each of the processes used for two-step metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), demonstrating systematic control of the polarity of GaN films on sapphire substrates. The potential for confusion in polarity control will be explained, taking into account the implications clarified in our studies. the correlation between the polarity and the growth conditions will be discussed in order to provide a mechanism for the determination and control of the crystal polarity during the growth of GaN films.},

  Abstract                 = {Bilateral filtering smooths images while preserving edges, by means of a nonlinear combination of nearby image values. The method is noniterative, local, and simple. It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness and their photometric similarity, and prefers near values to distant values in both domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standard filtering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate degraded GaN-based laser diodes (LDs) on epitaxial lateral overgrown GaN layers in terms of dislocations. Almost all of the threading dislocations that appear in the wing regions are a-type dislocations. Their origins are the lateral extension of dislocations from the seed regions that contingently bend upwards to the episurface. Comparing short-lived LDs and long-lived LDs that have almost the same power consumption, we find that the relative levels of dislocation densities in their respective active layers are different. In the degraded LDs, neither dislocation multiplication from the threading dislocations nor any structural changes of the threading dislocations are observed. This indicates that degradation is not caused by dislocation multiplication at the active layers, which is usually observed in LDs featuring zincblende-based structures. The degradation rate is almost proportional to the square root of the aging time. Our results indicate that degradation is governed by a diffusion process, and a detailed degradation mechanism is proposed.},

Though individually described by different authors before, a systematic study of these acquisition geometry-related artifacts in one place and across representative set of reconstruction methods has not been, to our knowledge, performed before. Moreover, the effects of these artifacts on the reconstructed density are sometimes misinterpreted, attributing them to the wrong cause, especially if their effects accumulate.In this work, we systematically study the major artifacts of single-tilt geometry known as the missing wedge (incomplete projection set problem), the missing information and the specimen-level interior problem (long-object problem). First, we illustratively describe, using a unified terminology, how and why these artifacts arise and when they can be avoided. Next, we describe the effects of these artifacts on the reconstructions across all major classes of reconstruction methods, including newly-appeared methods like the Iterative Nonuniform fast Fourier transform based Reconstruction method (INFR) and the Progressive Stochastic Reconstruction Technique (PSRT). Finally, we draw conclusions and recommendations on numerous points, especially regarding the mutual influence of the geometric artifacts, ability of different reconstruction methods to suppress them as well as implications to the interpretation of both electron tomography and subtomogram averaging experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {The decomposition of GaN powder was studied experimentally using two different customized thermogravimetric methods, dynamic oscillation TGA, and isothermal stepping \{TGA\} for a higher resolution of the decomposition start. A reproducible mass gain at slightly lower temperature suggests the equilibrium temperature to be at 1110Ã‚Â±10 K under 1 bar of nitrogen. A \{CALPHAD\} type thermodynamic analysis of all available phase equilibrium and thermodynamic data is performed. This includes the determination of the absolute entropy of GaN, 30Ã‚Â±4 J/mol K, based on a Debye- and Einstein-analysis of the experimental data on the heat capacity. An explicit equation for the fugacityÃ¢â‚¬â€œpressure relation of nitrogen, f(P), is developed, which is useful for the conversion of complex phase diagram calculation output. This is crucial because f can be several orders of magnitude higher than P for the high pressures encountered during GaN decomposition. Based on the consistent thermodynamic description, developed for the GaÃ¢â‚¬â€œN system, all thermodynamic data and various phase diagrams are calculated. They indicate a good overall agreement between the different types of experimental data (calorimetric, vapor pressure, phase equilibrium). The high pressure part of the decomposition pressure of GaN is actually predicted from the thermodynamic model in good agreement with the experimental data. },

  Abstract                 = {Optical microcavities confine light to small volumes by resonant recirculation. Devices based on optical microcavities are already indispensable for a wide range of applications and studies. For example, microcavities made of active III-V semiconductor materials control laser emission spectra to enable long-distance transmission of data over optical fibres; they also ensure narrow spot-size laser read/write beams in CD and DVD players. In quantum optical devices, microcavities can coax atoms or quantum dots to emit spontaneous photons in a desired direction or can provide an environment where dissipative mechanisms such as spontaneous emission are overcome so that quantum entanglement of radiation and matter is possible. Applications of these remarkable devices are as diverse as their geometrical and resonant properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholestasis is a common complication in liver diseases that triggers a proliferative response of the biliary tree. Bile duct ligation (BDL) is a frequently used model of cholestasis in rodents. To determine which changes occur in the 3D-architecture of the interlobular biliary duct (BD) during cholestasis, we used 3D-confocal imaging, surface reconstructions and automated image quantification covering a period up to 28 days after BDL. We show a highly reproducible sequence of interlobular duct remodeling, where cholangiocyte proliferation initially causes corrugation of the luminal duct surface, leading to an approximately 5-fold increase in surface area. This is analogous to the function of villi in the intestine or sulci in the brain, where an expansion of area is achieved within a restricted volume. The increase in surface area is further enhanced by duct branching, branch elongation and finally loop formation through self-joining, whereby an initially relatively sparse mesh surrounding the portal vein becomes 5-fold denser through elongation, corrugation and ramification. The number of connections between BD and the lobular bile canalicular network by the canals of Hering decreases proportionally to the increase in BD length, suggesting that no novel connections are established. The diameter of the interlobular BD remains constant after BDL, a response qualitatively distinct from that of large bile ducts which rather tend to enlarge their diameters. Therefore, volume enhancement is only due to net elongation of the ducts. Since curvature and tortuosity of the BD are unaltered this enlargement of the biliary tree is caused by branching and not by convolution. In conclusion, BDL causes adaptive remodeling that aims at optimizing the intraluminal surface area by corrugation and branching. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

GaN was patterned by e-beam lithography, using a SiO2 layer as a hard mask, and usual dry etching techniques. The membrane was released by underetching the Si (111) substrate. Micro-photoluminescence measurements performed at low temperature exhibit a quality factor as high as 5200 at 420 nm, a value suitable to expand cavity quantum electrodynamics to the near UV and the visible range and to develop nanophotonic platforms for biofluorescence spectroscopy.},

For a quantum dot on resonance with the cavity, the spontaneous emission rate is increased by a factor of five, while the probability to emit two or more photons in the same pulse is reduced to 2{\%} compared to a Poisson-distributed source of the same intensity. In addition to the small multi-photon probability, such a strong Purcell effect is important in a single-photon source for improving the photon outcoupling efficiency and the single-photon generation rate, and for bringing the emitted photon pulses closer to the Fourier transform limit.},

  Abstract                 = {InGaN quantum dots (QDs) have been formed by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition selective growth on Si-patterned GaN/sapphire substrates. The QDs were fabricated on GaN plinths grown within nanoscale circular windows opened in the Si mask by both focused ion-beam irradiation and photoassisted wet chemical etching. Using this process, the epitaxial growth of GaN plinths could be achieved on an underlying GaN layer spared from process-induced damage. The optical properties of the InGaN QDs have been investigated by low-temperature cathodoluminescence measurements. Compared to the band-gap emission from a reference sample of InGaN/GaN multiple quantum wells, the evident blueshift of the emission peak from the InGaN QDs was demonstrated. This result suggests that the carriers in the InGaN QDs were three-dimensionally confined. (C) 1999 American Institute of Physics. [S0003-6951(99)03733-X].},

We demonstrate how the large polarization field leads to a linear dependence of the exciton energy on dot size, provided the aspect ratio of the dot is conserved while the size is varied. We also present a useful analytical approximation for the electron and hole wave functions in nitride QDs in terms of Airy functions, which compares well with the solutions of a numerical computation. We note that the disagreement concerning the sign of the shear piezoelectric coefficient e/sub 15/ leads to a significant uncertainty in the calculated potential},

  Abstract                 = {The effect of indium surfactant on the stress in GaN films grown on SiC at 950 degrees C by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition was investigated using a combination of in situ wafer curvature measurements and ex situ high resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). As the molar flow rate of trimethylindium was varied from 0 to 4.5 mu mol/min during growth, the real-time stress measurements showed that the mean compressive stress of the GaN films decreased from -0.60 to -0.30 GPa. The lattice constants of the GaN epilayers determined by HRXRD confirmed the stress relaxation promoted by the presence of indium while the rocking curve measurements showed that the threading dislocation (TD) density of GaN films remains nearly unchanged. Atomic force microscopy measurements showed that the indium improved step-flow growth, but simultaneously it drove V-defect formation on the GaN surface, which plays a critical role in stress relaxation of GaN films. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed the minor contribution of plastic dislocation motion to stress relaxation by localized TD bending toward V-defects. A nucleation and growth model for the V-defect formation was developed to explain that V-defects are energetically favorable to form at TDs under indium-rich conditions.

  Abstract                 = {The effect of indium surfactant on the stress in GaN films grown on SiC at 950 degrees C by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition was investigated using a combination of in situ wafer curvature measurements and ex situ high resolution x-ray diffraction (HRXRD). As the molar flow rate of trimethylindium was varied from 0 to 4.5 mu mol/min during growth, the real-time stress measurements showed that the mean compressive stress of the GaN films decreased from -0.60 to -0.30 GPa. The lattice constants of the GaN epilayers determined by HRXRD confirmed the stress relaxation promoted by the presence of indium while the rocking curve measurements showed that the threading dislocation (TD) density of GaN films remains nearly unchanged. Atomic force microscopy measurements showed that the indium improved step-flow growth, but simultaneously it drove V-defect formation on the GaN surface, which plays a critical role in stress relaxation of GaN films. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy revealed the minor contribution of plastic dislocation motion to stress relaxation by localized TD bending toward V-defects. A nucleation and growth model for the V-defect formation was developed to explain that V-defects are energetically favorable to form at TDs under indium-rich conditions. This model shows that the energy barrier for V-defect formation is significantly reduced when indium is present, which leads to the relaxation of misfit strain energy by increasing the size and density of V-defects.

The investigation reveals that the narrow fundamental band gap for InN is near 0.8 eV and that the band gap increases with increasing Ga content. Combined with previously reported results on the Ga-rich side, the band gap versus composition plot for In1-xGaxN alloys is well fit with a bowing parameter of similar to1.4 eV.

This long-wavelength shoulder has the following characteristics: (i) its intensity is correlated with the side-wall quantum wells; (ii) the temperature independence of the full width at half maximum strongly supports a localized exciton recombination process.}

  Abstract                 = {Quantum dissipation and broadening mechanisms in Si-doped InGaN quantum dots are studied via the photoluminescence technique. It is found that the dissipative thermal bath that embeds the quantum dots plays an important role in the photon emission processes. Observed spontaneous emission spectra are modeled with the multimode Brownian oscillator model achieving an excellent agreement between experiment and theory for a wide temperature range. The dimensionless Huang-Rhys factor characterizing the strength of electron-LO-phonon coupling and damping constant accounting for the LO-phonon-bath interaction strength are found to be similar to 0.2 and 200 cm(-1), respectively, for the InGaN QDs.

Using hybrid functional calculations, we investigate the effects of nitrogen vacancies (V N) and Mg-vacancy complexes (MgGa-V N) on the electrical and optical properties of GaN. We find that MgGa-V N are compensating centers in p-type but electrically inactive in n-type GaN. They give rise to a broad emission at 1.8 eV, explaining the red luminescence that is frequently observed in Mg-doped GaN, regardless of the Fermi level. Nitrogen vacancies are also compensating centers in p-type GaN and likely contribute to the yellow luminescence that has been observed in Mg-doped GaN.},

  Abstract                 = {We report a void defect in gallium nitride (GaN) and InGaN, revealed by aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The voids are pyramids with symmetric hexagonal f0001g base facets and f1011g side facets. Each pyramid void has a dislocation at the peak of the pyramid, which continues up along the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½0001 growth direction to the surface. Some of the dislocations are hexagonal open core screw dislocations with f1010g side facets, varying lateral widths, and varying degrees of hexagonal symmetry. STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy spectrum imaging showed a large C concentration inside the void and on the void surfaces. There is also a larger C concentration in the GaN (or InGaN) below the void than above the void. We propose that inadvertent carbon deposition during metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth acts as a mask, stopping the GaN deposition locally, which in combination with lateral overgrowth, creates a void. Subsequent layers of GaN deposited around the C covered region create the overhanging f1011g facets, and the meeting of the six f1011g facets at the pyramid's peak is not perfect, resulting in a dislocation.},

Polarization effects and crystal polarity are reviewed in the context of nitride heterostructure materials and device design, and a detailed analysis of their influence in nitride heterostructure field-effect transistors is presented. The combined effects of spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization are found to account well for carrier concentrations observed in AlGaN/GaN transistor structures with low to moderate Al concentrations, while the data for higher Al concentrations are consistent with defect formation in the AlGaN barrier. Theoretical analysis suggests that incorporation of In into the barrier and/or channel layers can substantially increase polarization charge at the heterojunction interface. The use of polarization effects to engineer Schottky barrier structures with large enhancements in barrier height is also discussed, and electrical characteristics of transistors with conventional and polarization-enhanced Schottky barrier gates are presented. The polarization-enhanced barrier is found to yield a marked reduction in gate leakage current, but to have little effect on transistor breakdown voltage.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the recent progress in the design and fabrication strategies of III-nitride semiconductor microdisk lasers on sapphire or Si substrates. Involving more accurate lithog. methods in the fabrication boosts quality factors (Q-factors) due to the improved optical confinement of whispering-gallery modes (WGMs) at the rim of the microdisks with smooth sidewalls and perfect circularity. Quantum dots (QDs) as gain medium within the microdisks are investigated and promising for the demonstration of micro-lasers with super-high Q-factors and ultra-low thresholds. And these QD-cavity systems are also facilitating the research of cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the strong coupling regime and cavity-enhanced single photon emission (SPE) for quantum computing. In this paper, we also report successful fabrication of transferred GaN free-standing microdisks with InGaN quantum wells (QWs) on conductive substrates, which achieves a significant step forward to realize elec. pumped high-quality microdisk lasers on target substrates. Strategies of applying flexible transparent electrodes such as graphene and metallic nanowires are potential effective solns. for realizing current-injection of nitride-based microdisks.
