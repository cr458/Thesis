$\mathrm{In_{x}Ga_{1-x}N}$/GaN QW structures are key structures in present day light emitting diodes in the visible wavelengths. Despite the growth of III-nitride LEDs into a gigantic market with a projected overall worth of 64 billion EUR by 2020, III-nitride alloys suffer from a plethora of material issues arising from heteroepitaxial growth on foreign substrates with large lattice mismatches \cite{Bennett2010b}. A notorious issue in III-nitride growth is the high density of threading dislocations which are the source of highly undesirable effects in diode structures such as non-radiative recombination \cite{Albrecht2008} and leakage current \cite{Bennett2010b}.\\
Threading dislocations have been shown to result in inverted pyramidal defects at the surface of nitride epilayers, known as 'V defects'. The effect of these defects on LED performance is hotly debated in literature as they are expected by many to hinder LED performance due to their association with TDs. However, it has been shown that narrower QWs along the sidewalls of V-defects serve to screen carriers from the non-radiative centres at TDs \cite{Hangleiter2005}.\\
In this study, a 'multi-microscopy' approach whereby several microscopy techniques are utilised on the same features is used to elucidate the origin of inhomogeneous EL in $\mathrm{In_{x}Ga_{1-x}N}$/GaN QW structures. The correlation of emissive and structural properties at the surface of the LED structures using several microscopy techniques has allowed for the detection of hexagonal defects at the centre of the inhomogeneities. Following this, structural and compositional information obtained using this combination of techniques is then used to simulate and reproduce the inhomogeneous EL, thus elucidating the mechanism whereby hexagonal defects can cause inhomogeneous EL in LEDs.


\section{Sample Structure}
For this study, two multiple QW InGaN LED structures of different QW nominal thicknesses (3.5 nm and 4.5 nm) were studied. Both samples were grown at the Cambridge Centre for Gallium Nitride, with LED processing carried out at the University of Bath. The structures were grown on low dislocation density \nomenclature[z-LDD]{LDD}{Low Dislocation Density} ($5 \times 10^{8}cm^{-2}$) GaN template on sapphire, and consist of a 2 $\mu m$ layer of unintentionally doped GaN followed by a 3 $\mu m$ silicon doped GaN layer. The active layer consists of a 5 period InGaN/GaN MQW region, with unintentionally doped GaN barriers (7.6 nm). An AlGaN electron blocking layer \nomenclature[z-EBL]{EBL}{Electron Blocking Layer} (20 nm) and a magnesium-doped GaN cap (117 nm) were grown following the active region. This is shown schematically in Fig. \ref{LEDstruct}:

The wafers were processed into $1 \times 1 mm^{2}$ side contacted LEDs with thin oxidized Ni/Au current spreading {\it p}-layer Ohmic contact. Ti/Al Ohmic contact stripes were deposited on the {\it n}-layer and the Ni/Au current spreading layer in an interdigitated geometry.\\
QW thickness for both samples was determined from X-ray diffraction \nomenclature[z-XRD]{XRD}{X-ray Diffraction} (XRD) using the method described by Vickers {\it et al.} \cite{Vickers2003}. The QWs were grown using the '2T' method, whereby the growth temperature is ramped up immediately following the InGaN growth under ammonia but without metalorganic fluxes. The barrier growth begins towards the end of the temperature ramp, this typically leads to loss of indium during the temperature ramp which can cause gross well-width fluctuations \cite{Laak2013} but a higher barrier growth temperature is preferable\cite{Oliver2013}. '2T' growth is shown schematically in Fig.\ref{2T}.

\section{Experimental}

Initial evaluation of the inhomogeneous EL was performed in a Signatone S-1160 probe station under forward bias, as shown in Fig.\ref{probe}.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier


Following this, hyperspectral EL mapping with CL and EBIC were performed using a modified Cameca SX100 electron probe micro-analyser with a custom built cathodoluminescence set-up. Hyperspectral EL measurements were performed under forward bias, enabling the acquisition spatially resolved EL maps of the inhomogeneities. Following the detection of hexagonal defects at the centre of inhomogeneities using SEM-CL, the defects were analyzed using AFM and C-AFM. Finally, FIB/SEM lamella preparation techniques were used to perform HAADF-STEM and STEM-EDX on the defects, allowing for access nanoscale compositional and structural information required to reproduce the EL in simulations.


\subsection{Hyperspectral EL Imaging}
Hyperspectral EL imaging was performed at Strathclyde University with the assistance of Dr Michael Wallace. In order to study the device under forward current, the LED wafers were mounted on TO-5 headers and bonded with 5 µm Al wire. A Keithley Instrument 2401 source meter was used to apply varying forward currents to the devices and thus allow for the collection of EL. \\
Full EL spectra were collected with a spatial resolution of approximately 3 µm and analysed using custom software developed by Dr. Paul Edwards, allowing for 2-D maps of EL peak intensity, position and FWHM. At each pixel in the map, a full EL spectrum was collected by an Andor CCD camera. A full set of data extracted from the hyperspectral EL mapping is shown in Fig.\ref{ELfull}

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/Ch3/ELfull}
	\caption[h] {a) Probe station image b) EL peak intensity, c) EL peak energy and d) EL FWHM extracted by fitting the hyperspectral EL data under a forward current of 10 mA}
	\label{ELfull}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier 

It is interesting to note that from this representative data set, the inhomogeneities observed are brighter by a factor of $\sim 6$, blue-shifted in terms of peak energy by $\sim 0.08$ eV and have a larger FWHM. Although these values were observed to shift based on injection current, the overall trend observed in all data sets for both LED devices is represented by Fig.\ref{ELfull}.

\subsubsection{Current Dependent EL Measurements}

Current dependent hyperspectral EL maps of the same area were performed, in order to examine the behaviour of the inhomogeneities with increasing current relative to the 'uniform' background. The peak intensities and peak energies for injection currents for device C5610A ranging from 1-500 mA are shown in Figures \ref{peak5610} and \ref{centre5610} respectively.

The spatially resolved EL data shown in Figures \ref{peak5610} and \ref{centre5610} allow for the comparison between areas containing the inhomogeneities and the 'background' EL by thresholding the data set. This is demonstrated in Fig. \ref{5610peakcomp} which shows the behaviour of both the inhomogeneities (lablled 'spots') and the averaged background peak intensity with increasing injection current.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/Ch3/Peakcomp5610.png}
	\caption[h] {Spot and background average peak intensity against injection current}
	\label{5610peakcomp}
\end{figure}

\FloatBarrier 
It is interesting to note that Fig.\ref{5610peakcomp} shows the inhomogeneities experience a far sharper initial increase in peak intensity relative to the background based on the hyperspectral EL data fitting in the current range 0-50 mA, perhaps indicating enhanced current injection in the areas exhibiting the inhomogeneities.\\
Fig. \ref{5610centrecomp} shows the same current dependent comparison for background and inhomogeneity peak energy. Here we see the same trend, in that the inhomogeneity exhibits a larger current-induced blueshift in the 0-50 mA range relative to the background. The origin of the current-dependent blueshift in InGaN QW structures is attributed to the screening of the QCSE by the additional carriers injected into the wells \cite{Ryou2009}, and as such indicates the inhomogeneities are regions experiencing higher current injection relative to the background.

\FloatBarrier 

Device C5608A exhibited a similar current dependent relationship between the inhomogeneities and the background, as shown in Fig. \ref{5608peak} and \ref{5608centre}. As evidenced by Fig. \ref{probe}, Fig. \ref{5608peak} demonstrates a larger difference in EL intensity between the background and the inhomogeneities for C5608A relative to C5610A.

\subsection{Cathodoluminescence and Electron Beam Induced Current}
Having noted the behaviour of the inhomogeneities inferred from the hyperpsectral EL data, CL and EBIC data were taken over areas containing the inhomogeneities in order to examine their properties in more detail as CL and EBIC are electron beam based techniques and as such allow for a far higher resolution than EL mapping.\\
In order to achieve simultaneous CL and EBIC measurements, a Keithley Instrument 2401 source/measure unit was utilised in order to main the LED devices at a fixed bias of 0V thus allowing for the measurement of the short circuit current. During the CL image scanning, the Andor CCD camera was set-up to trigger the measure unit to record the current at each point in the CL spectral acquisition. The CL acquisition was performed with an electron beam at 10 kV and 1 nA. Unfortunately the secondary electron detector was inoperable during the acquisition of this data, as such there is no accompanying SEM micrograph for the CL and EBIC data. The CL and EBIC data for devices C5610A and C5608A are shown in figures \ref{5610CLEBIC} and \ref{5608CLEBIC} respectively.

Fig. \ref{5610CLEBIC}a. shows the inhomogeneities exhibit a lower CL intensity relative to the background, in contrast to the EL. Interestingly, the EBIC signal, shown in Fig.\ref{5610CLEBIC} for both inhomogeneities examined seem rather different. The feature closest to the contact region can be seen as a region of high EBIC surrounding a region of lower extracted current. However the feature furthest from the electrical contact shows far less prominent EBIC signal.\\
The features examined are far more prominent in the case of device C5608A. Fig.\ref{5608CLEBIC}.a. shows the detection of 'rings' emitting at a lower at a lower intensity in the CL at the location of the features. These rings correspond to rings of higher EBIC current as observed in Fig.\ref{5608CLEBIC}.b.

\subsubsection{Scanning Electron Microscopy with Cathodoluminescence}
Following the CL and EBIC scans shown in figures \ref{5610CLEBIC} and \ref{5608CLEBIC} performed at Strathclyde University, more detailed SEM-CL experiments were performed at the University of Cambridge using a Phillips XL30s field emission SEM at 5 kV equipped with a Gatan MonoCL4 system to record the CL signal. This set-up provides the additional benefit of panchromatic CL imaging, which allows for the detection of the features without the need for extremely detailed EL correlation.\\
Fig. \ref{5610-SEM-CL} shows the morphology of the features in the panchromatic CL and the associated SEM micrograph. The inhomogeneity appears as a region of lower CL intensity, though it is important to note the signal in panchromatic CL mode is the sum of the complete spectrum of photons collected. Nonetheless, this can be considered in relatively good agreement with the CL intensity recorded in Fig.\ref{5610CLEBIC}.a. Fig.\ref{5610-SEM-CL} reveals the presence of a hexagonal defect (outlined in red) which can be spatially correlated with the centre of the feature in the panchromatic CL image in Fig.\ref{5610CLEBIC}.b.

Following the detection of a hexagonal defect at the centre of the feature, a 32 $\times$ 32 $\mu m^{2}$ hyperspectral CL scan was performed in the region of the defect. Figures \ref{A-CL}.a. and \ref{A-CL}.b. show the CL peak intensity and peak energy respectively. The defect appears to show little CL intensity, which is expected to due the association of hexagonal defects with threading dislocations \cite{Bennett2010b}. However, the region surrounding the defect appears as a 'ring' of higher CL intensity. It is difficult to resolve differences in the peak CL energy in Fig.\ref{A-CL}.b. due to the low CL intensity disrupting the accuracy of the fitting process.\\
The same experiment was performed for a feature in device C5608A, which revealed a similar morphology for the features in panchromatic CL imaging shown in Fig.\ref{5610-SEM-CL}.b. in that the region surrounding the hexagonal defect exhibited a lower overall CL intensity.

A hyperspectral CL map of 2 $\times$ 2 $\mu m^{2}$ was taken to examine the emissive properties of the defect in more detail. Fig.\ref{11-CL}.a. shows that as expected, the region close to the hexagonal defect exhibits low CL intensity. Interestingly, the defect also shows extremely low-energy emission relative to the background, most likely due to defect-related yellow band emission \cite{Lyons2010}.

\subsection{Hexagonal Defect Structure}

The structure of the hexagonal defects found at the centre of the inhomogeneities was examined following their detection using SEM-CL. 

\subsubsection{Scanning Electron Microscopy}
In order to achieve a higher resolution in examining the defects via SEM, an FEI Helios Nanolab 650 SEM/FIB with a schottky FEG at 5 kV and through lens detector (TLD) was used to perform high resolution SEM imaging. This is shown in Fig. \ref{sem-pit}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figs/Ch3/sem-pit.png}
	\caption[h] {High-resolution SEM image of a hexagonal defect located at the centre of an inhomogeneity in the EL. The vertices of the facets are delineated by dashed lines.}
	\label{sem-pit}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier 

Most hexagonal defects located at the centre of the inhomogeneities fell within the 200-600 nm range, with some exceedingly large defects reaching up to 1 $\mu$m in size. This is rather uncommon for hexagonal defects in III-nitrides, as the lateral size of hexagonal defects is typically sub-100 nm \cite{Oliver2006a,Tsai2007}.

\subsubsection{Atomic Force Microscopy}
The topography of the hexagonal defect was studied by AFM performed on a Veeco Dimension 3100 with RTESP tips with a nominal radius of 8 nm in intermittent contact mode. The defect shown in the SEM micrograph in Fig.\ref{sem-pit} is shown below in the AFM image.

	\caption[h] {AFM image of the hexagonal defect.}

\end{figure}

By taking a topography profile across the hexagonal defect, we can resolve the depth of the defect as well as the slope of the facets.

\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier 



\subsubsection{Conductive-AFM}

\subsubsection{TEM Lamella preparation}

Preparation of TEM lamellae for the analysis of the defects requires some additional steps due to site-specific nature of the experiment. Standard FIB/SEM sample preparation methods simply require a 2 $\mu$m thick wedge of the sample to be extracted and thinned down to a thickness of 100-200 nm for TEM experiments. However, analysis of the defect and any associated dislocations which may be present at the apex of the inverted pyramidal shape \cite{Watanabe2003,Shiojiri2006} requires thinning to be performed in an extremely controlled manner. As such a method devised by Thomas O'Hanlon at the Cambridge Centre for Gallium Nitride was utilised to perform high-precision site specific TEM sample preparation shown in Fig.\ref{FIBprep}. A 'marker layer' consisting of a cross intersecting the apex of the defect is deposited using the electron beam, thus allowing for little damage to the unprotected sample and a higher deposition resolution than the ion beam. Following this a protective layer is then deposited using the ion beam, and a standard dual-beam lift-out method is used to extract the wedge of sample containing the defect. 

\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{Figs/Ch3/FIB-spot}
	\caption[h] {Marker layer deposition for high precision TEM sample preparation.}
	\label{FIBprep}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier 

The purpose of the marker layer is to serve as a guide during sample thinning. The electron beam deposited platinum provides contrast against both the sample and the ion-beam platinum in the SEM image. As the sample is imaged in cross-section during the thinning process, the distance between the marker layer 'ends' is an indicator of the proximity to the defect apex. As the defect apex is reached during the thinning process, the two marker stripes should merge into one at the intersection of the cross, as shown in Fig.\ref{FIBloc}.

A successfully thinned sample is shown in Fig.\ref{thinned}.

	\caption[h] {SEM image of a prepared TEM lamella showing the marker position and defect apex.}
	\label{thinned}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier 


\subsubsection{Transmission Electron Microscopy}

The site-specific TEM lamella prepared using the dual-beam methods, shown in Fig.\ref{thinned} was studied by HAADF-STEM performed on an FEI Osiris microscope with an extreme-FEG (X-FEG) \nomenclature[z-X-FEG]{X-FEG}{Extreme Field-Emission Gun} at 200 kV. HAADF-STEM imaging of the defect reveals it originates below/at the MQW stack, a possible explanation for the large size of the hexagonal defects relative to those reported in literature \cite{Hangleiter2005,Tsai2007,Oliver2006a}. 

\begin{figure}[h]

	\caption[h] {HAADF-STEM image of a prepared TEM lamella showing defect interrupting the QW stack.}
	\label{STEM-spot}
\end{figure}
\FloatBarrier 

The composition of the MQW stack adjacent to the region occupied by the defect was studied using EDX-STEM, where the characteristic X-rays emitted by the sample were recorded by four silicon drift detectors which form a solid angle greater than 0.9 sr. Cliff-Lorimer analysis of the aluminium, gallium and indium was performed using HyperSpy in order to quantify the ternary alloy compositions as shown in Fig.\ref{EDXspot}

The EDS analysis shows the disruption of the QW stack by the defect, as evidenced by the apparent termination of the QW In signal in Fig.\ref{EDXspot}.d. Additionally, the Al signal can be seen to overlap with the QW In signal, suggesting the presence of aluminium in the region disrupted by the defect. Furthermore, there is an observable indium signal originating from below the QWs. Although both the aluminium and indium atomic percentages observed in the region disrupted by the defect appear lower than expected (approximately 6-7 $\%$ and 4 $\%$ respectively) it is also important to consider the effect of the sample geometry in the collection of the EDX signal: due to the inverted pyramidal morphology of the defect the collected signal is expected to be reduced, and thus the atomic percentages obtained via quantification are expected to be under-estimates.

\subsection{LED Simulations}

In order to investigate the manner in which changes induced by the defect could affect the EL of the LED simulations were performed by Berrtand Rouet-Leduc using the APSYS simulation package, with parameters taken from J.Piprek \cite{Piprek2007}. The carrier transport equations are self-consistently solved and coupled with the Schrodinger equation to compute the confined states in the QWs. Fig.\ref{simsetup} shows the simulated LED structure with a hexagonal defect incorporated. In this case we assume the QW stack simply continues along the edge of the hexagonal defect as described in \cite{Hangleiter2005}, as the EDX quantification reveals a detected atomic percentage of indium of approximately 4 $\%$ below the QW stack. We assume a similar geometry for the AlGaN EBL, which is expected to follow the angled facet of the defect.

The simulation results are shown in Fig.\ref{simresults}. Fig.\ref{simresults}.a. shows overall radiative recombination events in units of $10^{28} cm^{-3}s^{-1}$. The region closest to the defect at the lowest QW shows an increased radiative recombination rate, indicating the presence of the defect can indeed cause enhanced radiative recombination under electrical injection in regions surrounding the defect. Fig.\ref{simresults}.b. shows two profiles taken from Fig.\ref{simresults}.a. intersecting the five QWs and indicates that the radiative recombination is almost doubled in the lowest QW close to the defect when compared with a profile taken further away.
